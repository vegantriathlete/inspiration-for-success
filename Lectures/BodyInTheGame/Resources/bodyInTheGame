Now that you have completed writing out a list of all your skills, it's time to take a look at those skills and:
see which ones intersect with a need that others have
assess your ability level in those intersecting skills and needs
assess your desire and willingess to improve on those skills that intersect with needs

Which of your skills are the strongest and meet with the greatest need?
How can you begin to market and employ those skills?

Put together a concrete plan of action for the steps you are going to take to being to market and employ your skills to meet the needs of others. I encourage you to create a discussion post attached to this lecture.
