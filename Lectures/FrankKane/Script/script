Frank Kane is a former senior manager from Amazon.com and IMDb.com, who left to start his own successful business, Sundog Software, in 2012.

Udemy contacted Frank about producing a course related to data science based on his experience at Amazon. Frank has since launched three courses on Udemy related to "big data" and data science that have attracted thousands of paying students and great reviews, and he's devoting most of his time to creating even more courses now.

Frank lives in Orlando with his wife and two daughters.
