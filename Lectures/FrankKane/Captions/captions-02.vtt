how did that go well initially was
pretty excited I mean I never heard of

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.670
it before it out thanks to like okay
cool you know this could be pretty easy

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.020
thing to try out and see where it goes
you know just feel like any other

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.010
start-up endeavor put out something see
what happens if so you know I decide to

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:31.010
get a fair shot put together my first
course which is on MapReduce them and

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.309
they helped me you know sort of stay on
target stay on schedule and gave me some

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.890
general guidance we can talk more about
what that guidance once in a bit

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.809
yeah you know when I got to the point
where I was finally done and I watched

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:48.210
it really great congratulations you want
your good job and then you know few

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.750
weeks go by and just kind of trickling
in still a writer like so who do you

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:59.350
have a you can contact us if you let
alone no not really relevant to the

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.059
course but it ok if there was anything
you can do to promote the course I mean

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.840
you have to be working directly people
on the forums on Facebook probably heard

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.830
legends of the chosen you and you can
actually get special promotional help

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.990
communities there stands with that was
well we need some social group to get

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:25.040
some reviews like your course then never
heard from them again until it back to

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.850
that and that's what I wanted to hear
about this is in the loop again with you

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.420
to me and he is gonna be sharing some
insider tips at the UK's he has had

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.770
conversations with me but what happened
here is you to me so I him on this

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.970
online platform in so they made an
assumption about 200 this guy's got an

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.360
audience with some digital products here
and so let's bring him to you to be so

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.079
he can bring more those people and when
they found out that he didn't have

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:58.880
mailing list and they kinda wins a
little bit cool like oh well

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.860
yeah we're gonna need to develop a
little bit more social proof here in so

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:09.099
was the situation that here you know
we've got somebody who's gonna be able

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:15.650
to bring some students cool I've got
this platform this gonna back me up and

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.209
bring me some students and so you know
when things actually went live it turns

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.420
out they're like oh wow you mean you
don't have any student you know they're

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.670
looking at each other

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.680
Frank didn't quit you know you cooled
off a little bit in Frankton bail as

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:43.000
well that was a mistake so so what did
you do when you left off oh gee I guess

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.599
shuttling all these

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.769
yeah I mean initially went through the
you know seven stages of grief or

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:58.989
whatever but you know what I gave up to
take some time or the search engine

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.069
algorithms to kick in and actually make
a course discoverable at all and then

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:10.109
you have soared this happens the use of
course even more reviews and you know I

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:14.420
like being in this wonderful flywheel
never point a couple of weeks started

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:21.079
taking this course so I decided double
down on it and see if I can you know

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:25.430
make it into something even beer in a
way I did that was by creating a brief

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:33.150
Peter course let people into this course
I had my five hour payday course for you

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:39.170
and then I created a more general one
hour a day at a very high level overview

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.630
of all things Big Data related and at
the end I had a bonus lecture that say

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:50.590
he liked my teaching style and more
coupon code and initially it was very

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.989
important sort of like getting a little
jump start my paper is on every used to

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:00.440
grow in further yeah we'll get to that
question is a good question mark he's

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.440
asked about how many of your feast is
converted to paying students so we'll

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.830
we'll make sure we come back to that but
when I do want to highlight here is

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:16.260
kind of an interesting way that he's not
the only one we take a break and then he

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.700
realized that I'm gonna try this
strategy getting her course that's gonna

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.360
be a free course as opposed to like
starting out of course he started

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.460
overpaid course and then later on
decided let me add three quarters and

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.090
that's a question that people have a lot
of times in the studio course out there

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.390
to get listed is paid and whether or not
they have any purchase that are not but

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.720
certainly when they've got students who
purchased it but maybe not as many as

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.560
they wanted to have the chorus they
start asking questions like wow

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:53.580
in the problem is particularly once
you've had your gonna be pretty upset if

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.990
you take a course that they paid for it
and make it three if it's free and even

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.610
if you don't have the patience you can
put yourself in a very awkward position

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.450
buddy who noticed that you know you made
it free

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:11.680
your kind of admitting defeat there so I
took a different strategy and said this

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:18.340
is the quarters but I'm gonna make a
separate recourse to ask as to act as a

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.250
leader course so either course leader
course whatever so now let's come back

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.430
to mark's question about and how did
that work out for you

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:33.050
conversion getting people into you're
paying

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:38.270
yeah because no one out of a hundred
that actually convert and it seems to be

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:44.510
a converter ADC everywhere he started
looking for her version but you know it

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.940
doesn't sound like much but you know
we're talking about thousands and

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:52.650
thousands of people are so they do add
up and they tend to be preselected

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:57.690
people that are like my course which is
a real bonus though someone sees my pre

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:02.050
chorus and they take my acres those
either my papers even better and I'll be

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.080
very likely to lead to good review and
feedback which in turn leads to students

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.590
who discovered organically so you know
100 might not sound like a lot of the

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:16.729
knesset of an outsize impact on this and
show you and you did say that you got

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:18.689
thousands of students

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:25.029
in your free course so let's talk about
your recourse a little bit more if you

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:29.419
advertise your free course how you
approach things with marketing that free

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:33.129
Coors you have tried everything but they
tell you to do you know you do

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:39.039
channels and you two promotions put it
on Facebook you know from outside

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:40.389
websites going into it

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:44.759
none of that is done as far as I can
tell I mean there might be some indirect

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:50.589
messages by adding to the course by and
large most of my revenue contribution

00:06:50.589 --> 00:06:56.149
organic and from the emotions that are
on using his own platform on students

00:06:56.149 --> 00:07:01.009
but of course though I'm asking that the
free course itself not the pay course

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:08.559
with your free course I did you just
like one strategy that that I talked

00:07:08.559 --> 00:07:12.519
about before with Mark Timberlake is the
idea that would you launch of course is

00:07:12.519 --> 00:07:17.569
that just put it on you to me they don't
actually advertising outside it was

00:07:17.569 --> 00:07:22.979
actually coming to YouTube looking for
that he noticed a freak or so with your

00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:27.769
free courses that you've done her or did
you actually gone out and they tried to

00:07:27.769 --> 00:07:32.409
let people know that you got this
recourse

00:07:32.409 --> 00:07:35.779
really put a lot of outside marketing
effort under the three course I did good

00:07:35.779 --> 00:07:41.719
on you like a lot of people and I'll
slow without some SEO and externally to

00:07:41.719 --> 00:07:48.779
make sure people good description given
up on a lobbyist external marketing

00:07:48.779 --> 00:07:57.269
initiatives out part of effort into the
pre-chorus sure in a lake that's

00:07:57.269 --> 00:08:04.419
probably good recourse to its own work
within you know me so I want to ask the

00:08:04.419 --> 00:08:09.539
students who are enrolled in one of the
things that will typically hear about in

00:08:09.539 --> 00:08:13.050
the studio when people give away all
these free coupons to appease course

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:17.620
they say I'm not getting any reviews in
the course

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:23.870
disappointing how is the engagement out
with your recourse right now

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:30.260
overall it's good I mean you know I get
like you know the day and wow you know I

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.789
haven't actually look at the actual
percentages I'm sure there's a lot of

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:37.969
people that are gauging but it's really
isn't hurting the score standpoint or in

00:08:37.969 --> 00:08:48.990
terms of conversion to minor courses so
I'm pretty happy with it so that's what

00:08:48.990 --> 00:09:02.000
recourse if you got two more big 3 vs to
right now working on my third ok so you

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.680
had one page 13 and then you did it to
another page of what was the next course

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:14.050
is very very much relevant courses
courses about taming big data with

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:18.550
MapReduce interview and the second
course they did with Petie spark

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:23.470
basically two different technologies for
solving the same sorts of problems that

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:31.529
despite being newer one in and were you
able to successfully promote from your

00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:47.589
students that were in the I was like me
but I mean disproportionate improvement

00:09:47.589 --> 00:09:54.770
by if you do have that audience the
people that are like you the first month

00:09:54.770 --> 00:10:00.070
that I launched my actions only about
30% of those sales people that I markets

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:04.170
you earlier it's been a very effective
means of promoting
