00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.219
share of mistakes getting the pieces
together here to get everything working

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:51.160
we are you get this we are right now in
Udinese Black Friday sales my computers

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.960

affiliate I D and go ahead check out
some stuff on you to me and make some

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:12.799
course purchases there and that'll send
a little bit of money my way and then

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.009
before we get started with this lab I
wanna let you know where you can find

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.860
the replay you know I will make sure to
post this again at other times

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.590
throughout the interview here but Frank
has made some coupons available for us

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.409
and then if there's any other references
that come up during the course of the

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.159
discussion I'll make sure that I get
them posted there at the replay and

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.770
overtime out actually get transcripts
together and session notes together but

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.180
this is a work in progress and have so
many hours in the day so there's some

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.630
good links to get you started out with
stuff here and that's another me

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:55.560
blabbing let me go ahead and introduce
my guest Frank Cain is a former senior

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.810
manager from amazon.com and imdb.com who
left to start his own successful

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.200
business sundog software in 2012

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.590
a few months ago contacted frank about
producing a course related to data

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.550
science based on his experience at
Amazon Frank has since launched three

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.810
courses on you to be related to big data
and data science that have attracted

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.700
thousands of paying students and reviews
and he's devoting most of his time to

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.650
creating even more courses right now
frank lives in Orlando with his wife and

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:39.160
two daughters welcome to the lab where
else would you like to tell the viewers

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.459
about yourself

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.640
well it's a pretty good summary but you
know the thing that stresses that long

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.680
story but if you months ago so it was
really just about three or four months

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.799
ago that you can be reached at the
institute a think about the Union

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:55.519
structure and very quickly things have
taken off so it's been pretty crazy trip

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:01.880
yeah it's so I found out about Frank
based on a post he did in the YouTube to

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.950
launch where he made reference to the
fact he said you know I just know that

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.049
it was only a few months ago that I
hadn't even heard of you to me now I'm

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:17.139
see that this is a full-time or a good
income but produces significant in me

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:22.609
and so when I saw that post I contacted
him and said hey I'd like to interview

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:27.540
you for that lab tests that I do so
before we get into those details

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.500
is is par for the course with the
conversations I have here I always like

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.670
to get a little bit of background about
my guess give you a chance to learn a

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.980
little bit of the above their backstory
in the things that they were doing

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:46.549
before they came to you and the so what
type of things were you doing at Amazon

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:52.109
and IMDB is on I was busy working on
their recommendation systems they know

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.639
that when you go to Amazon easy people
who bought this also bought

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:59.510
recommendations for products based on
stuff you bought it passed that's what I

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.090
so start off as an engineer on my way up
to the measure and actually mostly

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.510
focusing on personalization technology
is the machine learning and data lines

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:16.760
about locations at one point I dot com
just a subsidiary of amazon.com

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.010
and I ran their engineering team the
whole shebang but even there there's a

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.060
lot of recommendation and
personalization and data mining

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.010
technology going on because they have
giant databases movies and also database

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:33.550
user ratings for we did you know that
sort of the background I'm drawing up

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:40.650
his coursework ok so and I know when we
had our prep session here that you had

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.220
mentioned to me that the type of stuff
that you were doing hot really call it

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.780
big data or data science at that point
you're just doing what you did there to

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.780
give people these recommendations which
he didn't jump right into you to me from

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.240
there so you had done the work at Amazon
MVP and then you said you started your

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:08.080
own company so why did you resign in
IMDB to start your own company

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.000
well as mostly personal I mean yeah he's
pretty rotten weather for those who

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:20.960
haven't been there so we would Orlando
primarily was really getting change

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.940
after spending you know ten years in
Seattle and the time was right now from

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.690
Amazon so you know we ask Ashley pick up
and move across the country and be ok

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:36.180
for a while so seems like the time was
right to get out and do something and I

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.050
was initially had a non-compete
agreement with Amazon so I couldn't

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.550
directly related to what I was doing
there for a few years but to start my

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.770
own company duly software engineering
consulting and actually selling my own

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.740
software that specializes in computer
graphics for a while

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.270
ok so that was asked about dead the
company that you started so you

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:02.800
mentioned that it was dealing with
computer graphics so tell us a little

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:08.850
bit more about Lake as I guess what you
were doing was selling software to be

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:13.680
working it you know other people you
decided to go out on your own and start

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.110
selling software is that correct

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.300
doing like through your site you're
selling software that's right i mean

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:26.490
through the goal is to have a passive
incomes from contracting work you know

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.180
our picture I could pay the bills

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.330
always always always suggest you to
create a package piece of software that

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.910
you just sell over the internet and I
could sit back and provide some customer

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:44.639
support just like you to me but I large
nose and click OK

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:49.960
ok so how did that work out for you
could you do the same types of things

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.410
that you lost this on your own I don't
imagine you started with any type of

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:57.000
following when you launch your business
so what are the things that you did do

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:07.500
you get that software sales business off
the ground is kind of in each market

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:11.460
that I went after its kind of ties into
the topic of this discussion but what I

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.460
did is they went after the training and
simulation market primarily so there's

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:18.009
people here in Orlando that focus on
building virtual reality training

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:22.750
simulators for flight in combat in
military training applications and what

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:26.800
I did was provide technology actually
have a realistic representation of the

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:32.930
sky and clouds in water so it's a very
niche product with something that was

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:37.270
until that time though the good thing
about it is that you can identify your

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:41.479
customers pretty easily so you know I
can go out and get a list of the 100 and

00:07:41.479 --> 00:07:48.349
200 companies that are doing this stuff
and just mail them and responded to that

00:07:48.349 --> 00:07:52.260
is going to spread the word throughout
the industry that it kinda like this one

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:59.270
is pretty much saturated market ok very
good and what was your background in

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:04.080
terms of any type of programming stuff
that enabled you to be able to create

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:09.659
that you were selling before I want to
have as long as I should have but you

00:08:09.659 --> 00:08:15.199
game developers so I learn C++ and
OpenGL graphics technologies back then

00:08:15.199 --> 00:08:20.449
so I kept out with on the side while I
was at Amazon so I just made that way

00:08:20.449 --> 00:08:27.250
full time but afterwards again okay and
as far as your son died in those

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:31.830
products are you still making sales of
those products is used to have gone on

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:35.560
the side in addition to what you're
doing with you to me I do and you know

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:40.690
at this point is probably about 50% you
mean revenues far as you know my income

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:43.310
streams I think that's a very important
thing to have

00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:48.150
because you don't have a bar menu I mean
it is one for a man they can have their

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:51.220
own wins they might change their search
algorithm someday they might change

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:56.430
happy you know what they're quite here
is hosting your horses so it was good to

00:08:56.430 --> 00:09:00.870
have a backup so I'm still keeping
around for sure yeah a lot of people

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:06.330
bring that up as well as we have these
discussions about how are you supposed

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.460
to use what we do

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:15.279
discounts things in so so will your
sounds like you're doing here is you're

00:09:15.279 --> 00:09:22.730
happy and you know me but your backup
plan is dead you still got your son dog

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:26.640
software going on so you got other
source of revenue in the event that

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:35.400
things take a change with how they
platform is exactly i mean you don't

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:39.160
want to pay the bills on our own but the
son dawg

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:51.800
you can also be a very good very good so
I I already headed to fill in the

00:09:51.800 --> 00:10:01.010
listeners about what exactly led me to
contact you in first place how did they

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:05.380
find out about you I mean I imagine that
they were purchasing your graphics model

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:08.780
they weren't

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:15.800
remember when I started contracting work
just one of those contract job was

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:20.880
actually calling General Assembly in New
York City and they do actually in-person

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:25.280
training so they will have people that
actually develop curriculum for their

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:29.130
in-person training and back and they
need someone to help develop a

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:34.490
curriculum so turned out some goodies to
work with Amazon went on to go to work

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:41.410
General Assembly result to me they like
you that works so that together for them

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:46.470
and they had a background amazon.com
order market through my face on the page

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:48.630
for that course on their website

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:52.160
really that's how you found me grade

00:10:52.160 --> 00:11:03.170
so again just to get people back story
here so you that you your face was

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:12.310
flying training product and so they came
to you thinking you have a large

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:18.709
following the German bring to you that
was certainly there hope you know I

00:11:18.709 --> 00:11:22.019
think everyone in the expertise you know
they want someone that has some

00:11:22.019 --> 00:11:26.899
credibility in the industry that they
could draw on that can bring students
