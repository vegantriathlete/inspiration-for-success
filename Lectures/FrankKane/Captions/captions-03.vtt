00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
excellent while you know if it works for
you then you keep doing it right so

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.519
fortunate you been able to produce off
in a position that you are able to you

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.910
to teach one of those types of topics
just getting a lot of traffic naturally

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:30.349
onto the platform so let's see now let's
kill some insider stuff has given you in

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:32.870
while Frank is doing that i'm gonna go
ahead and open up a seat if anybody

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.960
wants to hear people to ask questions
directly so go ahead and tell us now

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.040
what kind of stuff

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.940
given the fact that you actually
contacted you twice know what I was

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:49.440
inside you know one of its kind of
common sense stuff but it's good to hear

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.160
it from the horse's mouth from the
people that are managing to me one thing

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.859
that I learned was there also very big
topics elections so what they want to

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.289
see your people that are finding new
hills so they want to identify topics

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:07.710
that people want to learn about
uncrowded where you get your life story

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.490
of a bottom until the following a higher
needs pretty quickly and they had some

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:20.770
specific guidance per share with you as
well one thing that they really try to

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.119
hammer home with me is that people are
trying to get a very specific value of

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.350
course you're offering so unless you're
offering them knowledge that will make

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:35.189
them a lot of money and turn right so
that's why you see horses that are a

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:42.020
promise you accreditation certification
courses that promise you a career change

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.720
in my case we're going out to people
that are may be currently employed in

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.500
the financial sector or data science
will want to move like west coast or

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.950
specifically get into tech startup sort
of environment in mind is so I think

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.200
very specifically about what your
students want to get out of this course

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.009
and speak directly

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.520
you know what you're trying to target
and speak directly to that target

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.540
marketing

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:22.239
they told me was January very important
month so they want to be very much money

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.569
to launch this new course in January
which isn't realistic at this point

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.579
given the holidays but I guess I have a
lot of demand in January because people

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:32.790
are kinda like coming back to real life
after the holidays and a lot of people

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.700
you know we're looking for a job in
January and you know that's the time for

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.139
you to meet where people want to learn a
new skill resolutions all that good

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:48.220
stuff to do so anyway turns out I'm
watching the courts that's certainly an

00:02:48.220 --> 00:03:09.810
interesting one to hear eyewitness out
here you know another challenge for

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:24.190
January for me just released last week
so a lot of people's interest to learn

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.620
about you have to keep that in mind that
the perfect storm coming together for me

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:42.159
here where I could be building up a lot
of traction so you and said that people

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:48.579
really wanna get some specific type of
outcome of course it's going to help

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:56.540
them improve their life ins your
situation a career change for for

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:03.729
instance and then the other thing that
you were mentioning actually I feel like

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:08.680
you mentioned the January the general
being important I think was like the

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:15.759
third thing that should be giving them
to specific benefit that they get out of

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:21.500
taking your money up your cross and then
what was known that you said they talked

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.270
about ok

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:39.180
r you have enough room to take over that
and so go ahead I just got so you want

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:47.629
me to think about while you get her
level courses so given the choice

00:04:47.629 --> 00:05:00.940
between the preview of which it makes a
lot of sense an opportunity to sell more

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:07.020
to beginners to experts because you
probably weren't to figure some stuff

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.360
out on their own right now and you're
not really going on on the beginners are

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:18.490
just wandering and they need something
that's in a given hold on to get started

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.969
is something to be interesting that I'd
like to because I have a lot of my

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:28.449
theories have been wronged by the way
that's where I started here but I had

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:34.630
this idea in my mind the experts also
recognizes the value of their time as if

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:41.139
you're dealing with somebody who's
building a hundred 250 bucks an hour if

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:45.349
they've gotta spend six hours are a week
or whatever to figure something out or

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:49.469
they can just purchase of course that'll
teach it to a few hours like they've

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:54.060
saved a lot of time doing that and I
think that would be worth money to them

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:59.779
so so I'd actually be curious to know
this whole thing about whether whether

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:01.120
you yeah exactly

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:09.770
opportunity whether the advanced courses
I'm not looking to go up against a huge

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:22.370
datasets I guess I'm obviously but I
still like this that there would be some

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:27.560
room for these expert type of things
particularly if you build a student base

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.539
reuse them

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:34.260
beginners and you're taking them through
the whole process loyalty you so

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:42.260
what are your thoughts on this

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:48.070
right i mean you know I think he
understands there telling us that

00:06:48.070 --> 00:07:05.630
there's gonna be a lot more aspiring I
read something that says no clear is a

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:11.950
lot more people on that her already know
this stuff like you think there's still

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:16.100
an opportunity to work people through
progression in your own course right so

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:19.220
if you have a big following in your
beginner level course they're still

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:20.580
opportunities

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:27.300
immediate level course to those people
course but has yet to have enough people

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:34.790
that are in that race course that number
in so what you think I do you know

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:49.690
anything you know I'm slow go read the
book so what kind of strategy so you're

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:57.370
working on this third right now and I
guess you're saying that as far as your

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:01.600
time is gonna work and you don't even
think it's too likely they launched that

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:06.020
course in January right now you're
probably right up for a while

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:13.950
production so how many hours are you
aiming to make this well it's growing

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:23.630
every day that ok and are you willing to
give us a little bit that teaser about

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:31.300
what the topic is addressing right now
with his third course yes general data

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:36.330
mining techniques so it turns out
there's two different planet universe

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:44.080
East Coast financial section dr. world
where people live and analysis using

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.380
tools like tableau on our end

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:54.960
west coast side of people that are
actually programming problems so in my

00:08:54.960 --> 00:09:00.970
case finishes the program so the course
at a high level is that a site with

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:06.900
Python and people that have a little bit
of engineering background program right

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:13.560
script I'll teach it in and out of it
happening I might have to take your

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:31.710
question about that so there's dataquest
I think they've got other things on the

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:38.010
internet where he gets into this whole
issue that people talk about in this

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:41.680
again this isn't just related courses
now so those of you are listening to

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.780
this you're like oh my god more talk
about these tech courses i hearing about

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:53.010
these everything about each keep in mind
the lot of talk about still enjoy this

00:09:53.010 --> 00:10:01.790
question also tighten it when people are
launching some of the challenges are

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:07.670
concerned about running up against
people say well I can just hear their

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:14.740
course are you thinking that you're
getting any type of resistance but there

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:18.790
are some i mean there's some sites out
there that much devoted to teaching

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:25.380
people to decide and they were doing so
some amount of it certainly for free and

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:27.490
have a lot of you

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:35.990
area you know they're actually doing
that have the ones that are offering

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:42.490
courses on the ok I mean yeah you can
piece together a lot of stuff going on

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:43.290
the Internet

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:53.600
a look at what's the value that operates
at a time when we get into a logical

00:10:53.600 --> 00:11:00.940
providing examples you can buy into it
actually you know they can actually

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:01.980
learn from
