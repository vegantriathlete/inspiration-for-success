00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.560
and as you mentioned that you actually
have some real world experience doing

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:11.269
this based on previous jobs as you head
so that's where so that the people are

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:18.050
fighting for free they may be there
finding somebody who's a hobbyist but

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:26.369
it's okay with you your course that you
mention all the pieces that is

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.920
structured gives him some examples and
answers and support the type of stuff

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.149
that but then on top of it

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.879
you have some real world you can bring
to it that understands they ok this is

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:41.649
how it works and why it works

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:47.930
yeah I think about a lot of me you know
my first course compelling with that I

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.300
tied it into a lot of really samples
that actually taste you know in my job

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.300
at Amazon and I was getting tell exactly
how we solve those problems

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.090
basis will come after me you know it's
hard to like real applications that

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:07.500
people see every day when they go to a
real people you know i think thats ok

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.530
yet another helpful tips for people that
in addition to them being able to get

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.159
some real benefit by the time they
complete the course is that when they're

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.560
doing the course that are getting to see
some examples

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.580
not just these sort of made up
hypothetical things but something that

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:32.270
people will see in in real life I you
know in their daily interactions that's

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.409
good to hear so he was curious about how
you were thinking about pricing in let's

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.380
talk a little bit about 12 minutes to go

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:50.680
tiller hours start winding it down here
soon but just in general how are you

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.770
thinking about setting the price points
were just talked about this the third

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.060
course that you're doing

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:06.119
yeah yeah I mean it's a gnarly subject
because reality is the bathroom right

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:13.569
yeah I mean what I've done personally I
price my two additional $9

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:22.560
this was nineteen and at the time I was
well I can undercut these guys but you

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.239
know I've read some contrarian evidence
that you know you want to price your

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:33.849
higher value but I'm actually experiment
with that literally no I am planning on

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:38.049
writing this new course higher in the
first because it is a bigger course it

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:41.959
has more content for its status more
ambitious than what's doing and what the

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:48.010
price can be so people are looking at
the Opera time giving instructors ok I

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.739
have recourse that the one hour overview

00:02:50.739 --> 00:03:01.989
$89 and then maybe 1 $99 that's a very
broad and varied that's right so for me

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.409
it's so you're differentiate between the
levels of those courses exact pricing

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:15.310
your courses against each other to give
people feel they're in so how how do you

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.900
feel about this whole thing with me $10
pricing you know buying courses for $10

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.509
and I mean right now we're in the Black
Friday promotion is just see how this

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:28.169
goes to the head $10 for a couple of
days it's been 11 for couple days it's

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:29.449
$12 for a couple days

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:39.689
13132 1450 how this works out like how
many people well I mean forget about 90

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:47.069
they're gonna send more $10 deals just
wait until Cyber Monday are already a

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:58.759
week so you know a lot of people do you
understand the $10 pricing model how do

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:05.919
you feel about it was pretty shocking
cuz you know coming into this world I do

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:10.500
not think about it so you know I like
what I thought I was gonna get you know

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:18.400
whatever you like what's going on there
but over time it did so you know my

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.690
attitude toward you now is you he has a
lot more information about what price

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:22.449
points

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:26.169
gather the most revenue in the long-term
experiments on this you know they're not

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:26.720
afraid

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:34.640
experiments on this which is why I made
a lot of money over the past weekend

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.120
from the Black Friday so you know lots
and lots of people in the daytime stuff

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.230
and bad up what's important to me is
that they don't add up in terms of the

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.610
quarter demands right so you know if I'm
getting you know a million students at

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.500
$1 each and every one of them has a
question that you want to answer within

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.630
24 hours that's not a good thing but
that's not the case you know it turns

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.470
out that people are pretty reasonable
and try to find the answer for

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:07.860
themselves by March quarter contact so
supportive as I really that bad if you

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:15.320
increase the price of your courses over
time maybe I would only do it as an

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.520
experiment you know I mean it's really
hard to be like any details on that as

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.030
an instructor obviously but one of these
months where it's like not something

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.890
we're going on like the holidays

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:29.750
completing the day at a time I might try
to actually raise it like 190 what

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.380
happens is it true that people will see
that as a bigger discounts and more

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:40.580
compelling or we'll just scare away the
hell did you make it so you actually do

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:46.830
get some full-price sales on you I mean
not a lot you know and up realizing that

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:59.900
out there and they asked for you know
risking losing those not so we're really

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.970
pleased so raising the price that's the
thing about you anytime soon but I'm

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:13.220
likely with its ok very good well
anybody wants any more questions out

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:22.590
there were gonna be wrapped up in the
next few minutes so yes I understand you

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:29.169
did you wanna be my guess your not I
don't know

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:35.960
about the option of value I don't know
if you've actually treated in the

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:48.749
courses courses this is an ongoing how
much people will buy you things and so i

00:06:48.749 --> 00:06:54.770
think is just different type of its a
new paradigm different type of a

00:06:54.770 --> 00:07:08.009
marketplace people have to develop new
pricing works in value and whether

00:07:08.009 --> 00:07:14.770
you're in there's arguments about this
you got it about whether you're like

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:25.370
cheapening your so and $10 type of
courses here in that's kind of a

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:30.279
separate discussion anyway about like
how you want to use you to perform

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:38.180
actually do choose to use your
introductory platform lower-priced

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:44.199
offerings on you to me and I'm gonna see
them in the hope that I can get them off

00:07:44.199 --> 00:07:53.729
in some cases so I guess let's wrap up
with that one that I just do you think

00:07:53.729 --> 00:07:57.629
about what your plans are for the future
particularly like you to be having some

00:07:57.629 --> 00:08:07.060
discussions are you see you did you
consider the fact that you got your

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:15.589
socks after we've already been selling
are you see you're likely to stick with

00:08:15.589 --> 00:08:23.080
you all stays as it is right now in
person or you see that you might have

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:27.790
some type of hybrid or what are your
thoughts in terms of

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:35.460
you know how are your interviews as far
as online courses go I'm glad it's

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:40.200
working really well you know i mean
there's maybe one or two other computing

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:45.760
platforms out there right now but
they're both you know I mean my

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:51.680
immediate goal is to get this number in
my head of where I want to be in the

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:58.570
long run and as long as I stay at that
number of questions about the courses

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:05.070
around so many course they're switching
mentally between the Montessori question

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:15.600
everyday and different topics so
long-term approach to going as well as a

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:21.200
backup plan just keep break horses out
there just because you know I'm gonna

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.660
try to focus on a handful they're
profitable and as you know I never

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:27.420
believed that knowledge exchange move on

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:33.230
courses will be client library but I
kind of want this worldwide corps

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:40.740
worries three main courses that i'm ok
and it doesn't sound like you really

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:48.240
have any thought about 200 I want to get
my courses on semi especially

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.640
considering that you said that pretty
much all your sales are coming from you

00:09:51.640 --> 00:10:17.270
to be organic try to pull courses on
your own 100% marketing your own pretty

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:22.940
well that kind of ties it all together
brings us right back feels the same way

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:29.250
that you saying like finding your niche
you're also keeping in mind what you're

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:38.910
going to be focused on what kind of
twisted around with with the other stuff

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:41.030
trying to get out of class for

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:44.400
and even like you're trying to chase
after course after course to try to keep

00:10:44.400 --> 00:11:04.130
things had a tight do what you need to
do it to me saying any more and more and

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:17.480
that's what we're trying to achieve it
you'd be right that is you know every

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:28.090
morning at the beach getaway with that
like over sounds get excellent player

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:33.740
and so you know I wish all of us much
success with that very thing get

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:40.240
ourselves in the situation that I kinda
got my diesel engine here that's

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:46.930
producing results and I can never see
jewel in comm with very little time

00:11:46.930 --> 00:12:01.120
investment trained adjustments in
practice I would never spend a whole day

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:11.380
and that's okay it's wonderful to have
the option to do it and get back to

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:15.280
doing some more work right now then that
would be your option

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:22.180
go ahead so before we wrap things up
here on just one more time here so you

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:38.190
