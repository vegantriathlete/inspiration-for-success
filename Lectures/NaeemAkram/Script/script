Naeem Akram Malik is a senior software engineer from Gujrat, Pakistan. He's been developing software for about ten years. Additionally, he is a blogger, a gardener, and a poet. He has two kids, both under 5 who love to spend time with him because they have a lot of fun together.

Naeem also worked as an Android app developer for almost three years. He worked through Upwork (formerly ODesk) and elance. Before coming to Udemy, he did a solo flight as a full time Upwork freelancer. His profile is considered “Top Rated” with 100% project success rate.

Teaching is his passion. He loves imparting knowledge to those who seek it. As a big fan of Tim Ferris, he looks forward to Udemy as his ticket to freedom. Once free he would love to spend time in his village where he would grow organic vegetables, read a lot of books, spend time with his kids, maybe travel a few countries, and of course publish new courses on Udemy.
