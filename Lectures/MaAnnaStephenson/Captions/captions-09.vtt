00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and you're absolutely right my Anna
would just sit up a balance between

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:13.130
listening to our readers and our
customers with a feedback and to see is

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.160
it something what does that mean we can
change and that's okay to do that but

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:24.980
also you cannot tell the business on
pretending to be someone that you're not

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:34.320
out of steam will come all this engaging
in January so people will not follow you

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.370
for that reason so my best advice and
not the easiest one man who are the

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.469
perfect example of that he was your guns
and who you are

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:55.170
week as much as in what remains of you
your business right I am who once you

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.079
find your boys and you find a tribe that
resonates with it they there now it

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.239
doesn't mean I'm always right about
everything or it doesn't mean that

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.489
things don't change to make what I said
prior you know tell people look at the

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.610
dates on my post for whatever was I
recommended three years ago may not be

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.220
the best thing now in one folks come
back to me about what you recommended

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.770
this is three years ago come on keep up
so look at the dates on post for things

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.450
that are constantly changing and I
reserve the right to change my mind at

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.250
any time

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.150
ok so don't hold my feet to the fire
over the fact that the industry changes

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.500
and pop out and out something new
because that's about to happen I'm about

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:39.450
to release some post that our people are
gonna go but its public service

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.390
announcement and I feel like I owe it to
my audience to be transparent this is

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.270
who I am I'm not out to hurt anybody

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:53.450
amount to work with people but I protect
my client by client base that's my main

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.149
thing and that's my number one
responsibility because ultimately that's

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:04.430
who I answer to not the vendors ok so so
I've got to be true that but but to your

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.560
point about forgot what I was just
thinking about those vendors kind of

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.790
took it out of me there for a second

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.439
2000 taxi being true to yourself so you
know said that taxi service about the

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:20.870
music so they would post what somebody
want you don't know who the client is

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.390
but they post whatever videos that the
clients wanting in use send them

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.689
whatever you have that meets the
criteria and this was back in the day

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:34.780
when we were coming out of synthesized
music back back into acoustics I can do

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.620
that and so I said this guitar recorder
thing in it was just love lives

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.900
beautiful and the reviewer for that
genre was just constantly sending it

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.150
back you could get their reviews and I
would some of them up in the music

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.000
business a long time and I would as well
as they doing after that it's just

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.319
somebody's opinion of what they like and
what they don't write but I had years of

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.780
being in the business selling stuff to
know about 41 in this one would be

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.590
remain he kept kicking it back he said I
love the song great recording blah blah

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.069
blah I hate that recorder

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:15.290
dude everybody this is the thing that
makes it you know and I just stuck to my

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.949
guns often it in 15 times without making
the change in the 15th time there was

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:25.479
another reviewer I guess they changed it
up or he had a offer he was overloaded I

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:30.989
got to the capital he said this is
perfect but it's so immediately and i

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.250
got on the note that this guy kept me
from selling that fourteen times because

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.489
of his personal opinion you're going to
do something about this you're killin

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:44.459
people's careers I could have sold it 14
times and so it made while money from it

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:49.199
too and I jumped all over about I mean I
jumped all over them in a dead guy it's

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:55.349
like you kept all of four making one
person's opinion but that's the industry

00:03:55.349 --> 00:04:00.750
that Fiat one person can make or break
your director for order whatever that's

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.810
the industry so you gotta be able to get
over that but it's far as catching on

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.359
you know sticking to your guns I know
all about that in windowless and I hope

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:14.680
some days I don't listen and it comes
back of me but for everybody will say

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.630
years ago you know

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.769
overnight success kind of thing it looks
like on paper

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:26.199
hardly been rolling that rock up that
mountain for years and now I thought

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:26.990
this spring

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.789
just this spring it started rolling down
the other side announced gathering

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:34.919
snowing here we go but I can give it
away when I first started I went out to

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:39.490
people even even one of my even a couple
of years ago I went to my hairdresser

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.639
this little strip mall that I do

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:47.199
sites for review of those people I went
to my hairdresser people and I said look

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:50.879
I couldn't give it away I can give them
a huge tits they just don't get it

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:54.830
whether or not said let me put some
money to it for you cuz everybody hears

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:00.099
money for some reason they don't hear
value they hear money and i said im

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:09.210
going to pay you $5 to let me do your
site in one year from now you pay may

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:16.669
all the extra money that you made your
over year and I'm gonna come out ahead

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:21.879
you know and they were like really and
all of a sudden they're interested in

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:25.860
having your site cuz I put a dollar
figure up with some value on it that

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.830
they could get because they don't know
how much more foot traffic they're going

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.780
to get even though there are three other
businesses in that Plaza that if

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.169
cancelled all there are other
advertising because of the sites I did

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:43.789
for them so if you're pushing that rock
up a hill there were days I went seven

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:48.430
to midnight seven days a week in there
were days I was fraud and i said im

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.699
gonna go car for a while I just need a
break I'm gonna go walk in nature do

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:59.060
something because I was fraud there were
times i SAT there and said why am I

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:05.300
doing this I'm not getting anywhere and
I just took a break in the knockout

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.949
revitalized I came back to it in it it's
not like you're gonna do it overnight

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:16.150
there was there was a I don't even know
if podcast is still their blog cast FeO

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:23.630
back in the day their very first podcast
like their first 30 podcast 450 podcast

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:32.449
after that they changed radically but
what interview these people and everyone

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:34.230
of them there was a theme you could hear
it

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:40.060
three to five years it took them to take
off I think you know me I mean cuz we

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.080
got a lot of you know me people people
you're with you to me I don't think it

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.910

marketing seventy you get going to get a

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:50.030
good course and you go out and help
