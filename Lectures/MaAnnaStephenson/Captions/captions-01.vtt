00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.250
sorry we are on their welcome to the you
to meet weekly inspiration for success

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:15.200
with May and Stevenson I'm mark Isaacs
and I started out on YouTube in January

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.840
2015 i've certainly made my share of
mistakes and I'm still learning how to

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.029
do this how you can in fact I started
out this morning totally screwing things

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.119
up here with practicing embedding the
bladder in my website in the night

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:35.329
killed off the bledsoe we all live and
learn from our mistakes if you want to

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:43.239
find me and you put up my profile here
you can see the three courses I've got

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:50.719
published right now and I'll quit coupon
code in there to get discounts my

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.949
courses now they are changing the blad
interface here and I'm noticing some

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.390
things that are a bit different about it
and we might even have made and tell us

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.100
a little bit about that in the course of
the interview but I don't want to rely

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:09.260
on here I'd like to introduce my guess
man is a guy who can still speak in

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.840
plain English and she helps nine gigs
create sites that get noticed by search

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.560
engines in breeders are secure they
convert and they perform well she

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:26.430
teaches on WordPress SEO content
marketing webmaster duties and so

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.900
managed quite as sharp here and she's a
little pistols who so strap yourself and

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.850
get ready for the ride so welcome to the
show

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.700
introduce yourself to do so much market
think you wrapped it up pretty good

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.829
right there that what they do what I do
I help especially not engage you know

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:51.840
because nobody is born knowing all this
stuff and and I do the real training

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.149
it's not the hype stuff of give you the
dreams of all that you can do i mean it

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.770
at the end of the day you've actually
got to go click the buttons and do it

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.070
and so that's where I come in I do the
training planes and I'm sure

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.950
everybody's gonna find this interview he
does have a lot to share with you when I

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.630
try to keep it still in under an hour
here so you can post your questions if

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.660
you want you can with this / orange /
cue to give your question

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.900
unfortunately you to me doesn't lab
doesn't give us the ability to filter in

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.220
the stream here anymore but go ahead and
you can post your questions in there and

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.370
we'll make sure to get to them at the
end but to keep things moving along here

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.260
we'll just continue with the first part
of it in like I said we will answer your

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.060
questions

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:46.000
the end so I mentioned in the intro that
may and it does classifiers as a geek

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.170
but that's not the only thing that she
does have a background she's done a

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:56.170
number of other things before she
claimed her geek title so may have done

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:04.500
besides you know came into the world and
intuitive and creative you know I got my

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.100
engineering stuff later on

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.880
lived in both world that has really
helped me a lot

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:17.760
being the kind of instructor that I am a
multi-instrumentalist from birth

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.510
you know about it on Monday hoping we're
professional musicians and I was playing

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.190
as soon as I could sit in somebody's lap
and everybody wanted me to learn their

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.130
instrument because I found it so much
fun thought multi-instrumentalist in a

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:37.500
published composer with AirPlay in 14
countries also book writer and several

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.519
job in published in three Sean rose and
my biggest book I think was featured in

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:48.790
Publishers Weekly shortly after its
debut in its own blending the rational

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.680
foreign foods and intuitive sign
everything from ancient philosophy all

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.590
the way through quantum physics and so i
cant underwater param an internationally

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.110
recognized woodcarver I just love it and
i ended up doing something that nobody

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:08.390
else period and it got me tell me it
couldn't be done in a lot of its

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.670
engineer correctly just figuring things
out

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.340
is a lot of a lot of figuring things out
and of course figured out I'm gonna pass

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.620
that information on a natural way that
may be a teacher and home those skills

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.620
over a lot of yours in a really really
enjoy it

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:32.380
ok so you guys can hear it has got a lot
of your background musician woodcarver

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:38.740
she's published as well he said blending
of Sciences in this kind of a common

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.460
thread there were gonna find out here
about how many and all of these things

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.970
and put it together and she mentioned
that she loves to help people that makes

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.290
her want to be a teacher to learn
something new and that she wants to

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.610
communicate that knowledge to other
people so me and it's possible some of

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:01.860
the other training did you done prior to
coming to you while electronic engineer

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.250
for thirty years and I did a lot of
technical writing I worked directly with

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:12.020
engineering on fixing problems are owed
documentation for laypeople and for

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:18.530
engineering fail so the common thread
for me is just being that bridge between

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:24.880
the high-tech that needs to get done in
the people who use it and so I thirty

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.680
years of that and working directly with
clients and you're in a problem in the

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.900
buck stops here

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.410
type of service from service all the way
through tomorrow in its got to work and

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:40.419
it's got to be easy and so that really
gave me a great background for being

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:45.840
able to teach what I do and do the
technical coder did website for years

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.610
back in the day when you head to have a
code or to have a website got out of

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.479
that once were present to go over the
world because that really got into

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:59.810
design more than anything and so I went
into teaching you know in discovering

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.610
things figuring out how to do the
integrations and talk coding in top

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:10.760
designers and people like that for a lot
of years before open blockade in that

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:16.690
was kind of a sister site of I have a
site now what about all the marketing

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:21.630
side of it and the user inside of it and
you know I ended up having a lot more

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.900
engaging with people directly which I
dearly love

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:30.330
and one of the reasons I love blackout
so much and it's the direct engagement

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:35.830
so that's the background of what got me
into blog ate in the teaching ever since

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.780
I open up my own membership library

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:45.800
a some of the deeper information for you
know the click here do that kind of

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:51.699
generic for the classes that all is one
on one which were uniquely tailored to

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:56.500
each person's height and they could go
watch the videos for the click here do

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:00.910
that you know kind of stuff and that's
where I got into making video tutorials

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:05.630
did that for a lot of years and have
been want to get on you to me for quite

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:10.370
some time and just expand to another
platform mainly alright let's not jump

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:15.010
to you know me too quickly though so
when did you produce your first well

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:22.060
whether you produced your first video
tutorial paid or otherwise free ones

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:28.039
that are put up on youtube or probably a
solid year before I even develop my own

00:07:28.039 --> 00:07:32.639
membership classes matter of fact I had
to take those down because they were

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:37.699
gonna be the paid stuff in my membership
levels are much shorter ones for you to

00:07:37.699 --> 00:07:42.970
that we're very specific and one little
aspect it's like if you want more more

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:45.360
how to do all of this with the plugin

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.599
come over to my membership site so it
became a film's final

00:07:48.599 --> 00:07:52.889
honestly don't remember how long ago was
five or six years ago I guess at least

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:58.940
they're not fair enough so five or six
years ago you were already on you to put

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:03.870
up some of these types of videos in you
said you did it for like a year before

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:08.120
you even did your own membership site so
tell us a little bit about that

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:16.750
membership site launched well it was the
backup mainly to back up the 101 climb

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:20.930
that I had you know the training clients
that I had and they could go back over

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:26.550
the information again at their own pace
in do the click here do that kind of

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:30.820
stuff that hone their skills and it was
really helpful for that and I decided to

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:37.270
make it a standalone product and so chop
it up into a bunch of little products

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:41.720
and then a whole product you know for
you could you could start at $1 and come

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:46.830
in and get just what you needed any good
walk up that sales funnel into more of

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:49.980
what you needed and it was so much
better than just jumping all over

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.700
YouTube buying things are out of date

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:58.010
trying to get tips from here there in
yonder it was it where you go to one

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:03.210
place and get all of it and just step
into it as you needed and then over are

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:07.530
to say get all of it you know here you
go and I thought people regularly come

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:12.590
in at a dollar in the next week there
might well be the next week they would

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:15.850
get the overarching whole thing they
just get all that middle

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:21.530
up to the bigger program and opened up a
second membership right that's geared

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:28.580
more toward webmaster training a lot of
designers be a people who need to

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:32.450
improve their skill fared in make site
secure you know security and performance

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:38.470
practically took over my business was
here last summer and it is not down yet

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:42.420
in there are a lot of folks who need
that information so I basically did

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:47.990
another brain dump and made 76 videos or
cloth or other rebels or webmaster

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:53.490
training in that starts with installing
Wordpress securely and then securing the

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:56.640
entire installation you're you're
hosting everything the data base

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:01.140
everything about it and then performance
