00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
ok so we're gonna start inching ever so
closer to actually talking about the

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.840
deal with you to be here now let's move
on to blog because I think blogging is

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:19.570
basically like that next immediate step
before how blogging this we're so now

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.369
just tell us a little bit about blogging
how long you been doing that and I

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.500
believe you kind of already just a
little bit here but tell you happened to

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.960
come to see it to blogging yeah I
started in this business teaching coders

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.230
and head that fight and blockade became
the sister side of you know what I do

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.070
with my site now and are covered social
media about before there was just this

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.780
plethora of people that specialize in a
covered everything about marketing and

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.360
not so much

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.480
version and not so much because they are
going on anybody's radar at that time

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.940
that was like six years ago

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:03.340
07 right it's been awhile but that
really wasn't on anybody's radar at that

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:09.210
time but I started covering it when it
was and then actually that got way more

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.780
popular with have been way more fun with
and blogging just kind of took over and

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.640
then I moved the technical over into a
closed down the other side quit teaching

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.490
code got out of code myself and that was
inadequate teaching it's because I don't

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.860
want too much to do with any more word
breath taken over the whole world by

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.369
that time and I didn't want to compete
with private garden that were building

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.540
these gorgeous beautiful site that I was
more of the developer in all about the

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.590
code in the function and where prince
was really attracting the graphic

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.530
designer said that point there were made
him

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.460
beautiful things and that is pretty much
the split you know they make beauty and

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.350
developers make function and if you can
get somebody who can do both or a team

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.270
that can be both you have a great site
but I really loved engaging with

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.290
end-users and finding out how people
were using it and I have to tell you I

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.179
tend to hurt and I don't know what I'm
doing but I hope I just keep doing it to

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.020
attract people who are putting good out
into the world

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:20.030
world really reputable great super
people who are just the whites in the

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.050
world and I don't know what I'm doing to
attract them but boy howdy I hope I keep

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.470
doing it because I love working with
these ppl me I think I got the best

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.180
clients on the planet so what a joy to
get up and do that every morning right

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:42.480
and blockade I just had to maneuver
we're helping change for being a downer

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.880
you it's changed radically I was having
to change my business model Mr offering

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:55.650
every six month and kind of settled out
I think a little bit for sale but it's a

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.620
very opportunistic sort of business and
you gotta be able to jump on things and

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.570
at some point along the way I learned
that being bleeding edge there is some

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.290
serious money in being ahead of that
curbing bleeding edge being the first

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.670
out there and I actually learned it from
some of my clients that are always in

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.790
some of them were here today that are
always jumping on the user always

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.570
reporting on you know I'm gonna call out
one in particular on Hoffman is here

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.420
today and we follow each other religious
late because she can't she kinda covers

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.100
a sector that maybe I don't not comic
covers more of a sector that she doesn't

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.900
in between the two of us we keep up with
all the movies but I can't make it

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:41.140
without following about 80 blog quakers
being one of them that I rely on to keep

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.160
up my links me up this another 10 people
who just stayed in these white men

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:52.810
always people who stay right up with
news and a trainer I me to be able to

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.860
stay up with that to show people how
they want to jump on by up here you go

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.030
here's the information sometimes
requires me to stay up till three in the

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.450
morning making videos to put out saying
hey something rolled out on black basalt

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.160
at nine o'clock that night

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.220
here's your video and then to go put it
in my court and whatever so it's kind of

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.970
a crazy live to stay that way but I have
clients that I care take that are

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.870
leading edge maybe not bleeding edge
because we like the table fight but

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.950
leading edge with interest in

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.130
you know different markets that maybe
I'm naughty and all these lifestyle

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:37.130
bloggers people who are into visibility
who are into tech help keep me leading

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.110
edge because they're keeping up with
them and they're asking me to keep their

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.620
sites up with that so I get a lot of
work with a lot of things

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.260
way beyond my own fight because I do so
I doubt it I get to work with hundreds

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:53.900
and hundreds of Fine Arts in all kinds
of genres and I get to see all kinds of

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.230
plugins and you know different ways of
doing things so I think my exposure to

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.330
it helped me when somebody comes to me
and I can say yeah I've seen that I've

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.110
got some ideas for your health at work
and I could do that with just my own

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.120
fight there's no way I could get all
that so I'm very indebted to my client

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:20.490
is very much a mutually beneficial
relationship to work with my clients so

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:30.820
they're gonna ever so closer here and
blockade I do believe you've got

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:39.490
subscribers they can purchase training
from you the link in their view like

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.840
four people on I'm sure you might want
these for your show no got a link for

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:50.540
the video courses both private
membership site and Onew to me one of

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:55.740
those with the st. the fourth is the
same in both places whichever way you

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:01.560
wanna take it and but all my private
side it's part of a bigger things so if

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.810
you want all of it it it behooves you to
come in to do that and then I have

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.190
one-on-one training I have just started
doing group training for that one on one

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:15.000
training I have to keep the group's
extremely small because it is tailored

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.150
unique to each side owner and so you
know even five clients is a lot that

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:26.070
upper do it one on one but this keeps it
more affordable for everybody's I'm just

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:31.630
trying those wild with it so you can see
all that also have a page specifically

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:39.030
for you to me and the reason why is
because you to me

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:43.200
limits me so much in the contact that I
can have with them you know when

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.700
something like Blair bitch changing
constantly I'm too limited by that

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:52.540
opened up a Facebook group for months
students for their rethink its up got to

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:56.100
be able to get that email or up got to
be able to get that information out to

00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:00.980
them but it takes a village and I don't
want to just to be an email one white

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:06.260
thing you know and they asked me what
they're having trouble with and I get to

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.360
go feed their shows and we get to help
each other and support one another and

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.800
that's the whole point of lab so I think
it's more in the spirit of of what

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:20.790
lobbyists and the joy of it and come on
let's have some fun but you go ahead and

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:25.410
throw Lincoln therefore your bled like a
pro course you put forward or not but

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:31.410
you can go ahead and let me make sure
I'm on the right one thats NCO lab

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:32.530
cubans

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:40.800
yeah I've got 14 were actually I don't
think I've got any right this second

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:46.700
contact the pages that are already when
you find them just contact me and I'll

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:50.850
make up a new one actually I didn't
realize that they had it just expired

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:56.050
cause you know I know this particular
replay will go on that but we're getting

00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:06.700
ready to cancel mine for the time being
I'm sorry I have one I dunno but I will

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:10.120
actually make this replay available as
well on my website I will link up to

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:13.030
that at the end and I'll make sure I got
the show notes I'll make sure I got the

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:14.620
links to the various things

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:18.540
lab is actually changed with the used to
do what the replays you could actually

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.850
still at comments and the comments and
you can actually throw back to see

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:24.920
through the whole common street you
can't do that anymore not only can you

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:30.940
not add additional comments which i
think is a good thing that was the whole

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:37.120
stream anymore either so I will make
sure that it's available at least right

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:40.890
at the end when we're wrapping this up
here so that people will be able to get

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:44.920
back to the replay later on with all of
the important links

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:50.170
in me and make sure to put together some
different coupon codes right after you

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:51.079
better get it
