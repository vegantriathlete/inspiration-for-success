important figuring out what's going on
in like manna said it's not just him is

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.310

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.040
your audience you know even in my free
stuff

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:22.909
for my $1 video i put a time limit on

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:29.239
flat-out happy you're enjoying this your
two-week time limit is coming up I can't

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.040
afford to do these for free

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.390
yeah these are really high quality
things and if you see that then go ahead

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.069
and do about the 10 bucks 10 bucks a lot
of money come on up to 10 bucks get way

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.859
more of them but also return the favor
of supporting me because I'm producing

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:50.709
this and if you you want me to keep
these updated I have to be paid I'm not

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.430
going to do this several of my heart up
a lot of that already going on I'm not

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.079
running the ball onto your kind of
organization charity organization here

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:05.010
I'm running a business info I try to
keep you know here's why it took me a

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.900
long time to get to this because I'm
service all the way through to my phone

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.069
service means I'll give you my shirt
I'll take food out of my mouth to give

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.799
it to you out that that way all the way
to my bone that's a horrible mentality

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:22.810
for being in business that's why service
people don't usually do very well in

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.609
business for it or they have a manager
they worked for somebody they do way

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:30.919
better working for somebody instead of
for themselves

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:37.000
it took me a long time to come to this
but my motto and I have to say to myself

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.049
almost every day in business to make
money helping people in that order

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:48.949
the bottom line is I'm gonna help people
no matter what I was volunteer work for

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:53.799
25 years I probably work harder at that
than anything I've ever been paid for

00:03:53.799 --> 00:04:00.510
right I'm going to help people that's
not questioned her now I need to find

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.709
out how the thing myself while I do that
and cheaper than most people are that do

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.909
what I do at the level that I do it the
reason why I've got foot in the door

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:17.590
pricing because like I said people come
in at $1 and leave at 1501 face value I

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.670
don't have to do any more sales

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:25.720
that the job done it and I don't really
do a lot of films and promoted but my

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.350
thing is just promoting in general you
know making sure that people know what

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:37.460
they're saying things like $175 thought
it saved one of my clients $2,400 in

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:44.090
hosting I just need to get that word out
there so people can see the value so I

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.910
think you train your audience and how to
treat you if they also constantly in

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.500
that with another problem I have with
you to me is their constant take out

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:59.220
$300 product but I don't pretend I was
like whoa but then I had to back up and

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:05.320
the whole point of being known you to me
is volume its sheer volume and if you

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:13.880
fail you know $1,010 that's more than
filling 2300 the last time I did the

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:22.500
mail so they're doing so much emotion
for me once you trip there think I got a

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.890
thing the other day I just took a mean I
have no I haven't been on you to me long

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:29.320
enough to know if it's hard to get are
easy to get but they say things that

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.330
you're in the top group of instructors
from the feedback we got from your

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.270
students are like thank you all I don't
know if that's easy to get a hard to get

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:43.350
or whatever but it made my day and you
have to prepare wires you know to get

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:49.160
them behind you too so it's not it's not
as easy sound that's a lot of

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:54.120
promotional products first day on you to
me in 23 hours on my bob hundred dollars

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.910
and that was with a 55 percent discount
and some of it free but that was my own

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:03.950
peeps in the reason I did that it's good
third more likely to actually take more

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:08.890
of the course and also more likely to
leave me raving reviews which is what

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:16.490
you need to get started you need to get
that ball rolling with mutual that I

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.300
gave them something about you and they
gave me something about you bought it

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.300
about you and I don't have any problem
asking them for that and they're happy

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.410
to support me look they're already
supporting me they're already locked

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:31.670
into me so I've got no problem going to
help me out there like yeah sure

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:37.760
you know it get that ball rolling and
after that you know I got rocket after

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.600
that it has plummeted but it's going
back up again and that's the whole thing

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.950
about you to me it's a long game in like
Mark food you have to have more courses

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:49.880
which are planned to put up I absolutely
you've got more on the web at one

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.830
sitting right here right they'll

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:55.430
helping to get out for Black Friday if I
don't think it's gonna happen discover

00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:02.570
the time but I will get it and you know
I got five more courses at least five at

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:07.640
not fix it it's about clustering and you
know you start to do your own promotion

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:15.520
with the end the UNAMI sales final two
inside just like it works outside work

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.800
in it man it's gonna take me six months
to get where I wanna be I'm nowhere near

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:24.340
where I want to be but I have you know
what I think I've been on there are a

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:31.200
couple of months and I don't know 1200
$1,500 forger than I was before

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:35.680
could have made more had entered all my
membership site membership fight about

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:41.680
three times more but it's a long game
with the long game

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.370
benchley make way more
