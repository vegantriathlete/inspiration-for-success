00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
so ambiguous

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:13.910
interesting I thought I had it locked ok
very hot big thank you to everybody in

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.150
the comments to that have put up links
for me on my behalf thank you thank you

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.769
thank you thank you thank you wanna so
great to see you and good morning my

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:32.930
time anyway good to see you man and good
to meet you mark so I have a question

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.480
for man I'm sure some of us would love
to know Samana here's what I've noticed

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.600
about you you were really truly
successful at what you do you have a

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.149
good number of clients to the point
where you have to turn down lines that's

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:50.270
how popular you are

00:00:50.270 --> 00:01:00.859
and yet we see you can continue building
your brand not stopping not developing

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:09.549
constant people so the question is do
you when you're that successful at

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:14.390
making money why do you still need to
promote yourself and you know some

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.350
people might not want to know that and
try out do you go around promoting

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.799
yourself even more so

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:25.580
and leverages selcan skill your business
doesn't make sense yes it does and I'm

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.729
happy to address that yes I am how
successful however I'm not making any

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.920
where near the income that I was before
I quit my day job and I'm trying to

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.579
replace that you know I'm making more
now most blockade then I was making

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:45.710
being able to say part time but it was
anything but I was working two full-time

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.720
jobs for five years and went from seven
to midnight seven days weeks make this

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:56.729
happen god's ok you know it's not easy
so I'm still trying to get back to the

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.680
basically the level that are wise at
least with the day job I'm not even

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.270
quite they are white further than a wise
with just blogging you know double-digit

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.430
but I need you know I still need to get
back to the lifestyle that that I want

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.650
to go over that the whole idea was to go
over it because I have the potential to

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.300
bring in tens of thousands a month you
know I'm not they are but I have that

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.739
potential and i wanna I want to reach my
potential who actually do it's not about

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.890
money it's about serving but it's about
volume and that's what you to me

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.310
offers me is about buying but the nature
of the business is that I have to change

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.040
like black came along but it has
revolutionized my business because it's

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.980
a perfect for for me you know I went
over and I'm gonna say that you have the

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.590
best periscope tutorial obscene period
or none but periscope it's not a good

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:56.299
fit for me it's a one to many it's a
broadcast engaging with people in lab if

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:01.200
such a perfect fit for me because I'm
here you know I'm gonna write about it

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.620
you know I'm gonna do post about how to
use it as a unique course and so now I'm

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.040
thinking along those ways but security
performance was not even on my plate two

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.970
years ago and it completely took over my
business because it had to help website

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.130
owners so in some ways almost have no
choice to keep innovating because the

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.790
industry just keep changing and you keep
up with all the time you know something

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.549
here today gone tomorrow in keeping on
top of all those platforms cause you

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.859
cover a lot of social media to every
minute of every day something's changing

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:40.040
in keeping people informed so I think
it's kind of built into our industry at

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:46.349
this point about the fast pace of the
change and what whatever hot it's a very

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:53.090
opportunistic business when I got into
doing WordPress video thought I'm going

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.470
to you know a month making videos that
are just going to have to be replaced

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:03.870
six months eight months from now and now
it's every three month is the ROI there

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.840
I had to go to work this year to make
sure was cause we're press is updating

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.120
so much faster than it did when I
started out so I read

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.790
I actually looked to see if there are 0
I was there in a deal I did the same

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.079
thing with lab it's like oh dear god
this is in beta and it's changing

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.940
everyday cannot keep up with all else I
have going on very conscious decisions

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.800
of I can't afford not to

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:34.260
and that's true though it's a tough
business it requires I don't have kids

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:42.190
you know a little dog I have my life my
schedule is my own and I came so I know

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.380
but that's not true of everybody all my
mommy bloggers and people like that men

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.710
like they got a family to cure take some
people are doing this part time and

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.580
whatever I did it with the job full-time
job where I was on the road you know

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.720
it's not like I could even sit look or
have something on in the background with

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:05.260
this it hard and I think that is really
what separates everybody is I make the

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:10.850
time of my life to make it a priority so
there's there's an important things for

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.200
people to hear there because one even
though me Anna is successful first of

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:22.020
all the success hasn't come easily she's
put a lot of work in Lake overnight and

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.960
I think a lot of people on you to me get
hung up with this idea oh you eat

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.780
millions I'm gonna put a course on there
and I'm gonna start making thousands of

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:35.150
dollars jizz but it doesn't there's a
whole lot more work that goes into it

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:40.300
and then on top of another important to
keep in mind here is that you know is

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.860
asking me about how come you're working
so hard

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:48.320
marketing how can you keep innovating
you're already sources saying I need to

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.690
do to stay successful so it's not like
ok now you created a course in equities

00:05:52.690 --> 00:06:03.349
earning some money in now you get to say
i'm john this whole idea income as it

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:10.979
might like you can make sales when
you're not actually the computer when

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:14.370
you're not working it's passive in that
sense but it's not passive in the sense

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:19.650
that you don't have to do any more work
great example yesterday you know have a

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:24.670
show that the day before this when I
heard right in and so on

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:28.910
people about being a woman's right to
see all of my webmaster training right

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:34.510
behind that you know I gave a discount a
nice discount for sale that's actually

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:41.170
coming later on went ahead and gave them
that this can head to fail but for that

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:46.030
play out all the information that I gave
during that black all the work that I

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:51.870
before that you think you did an hour
blabbing you made a $500 or whatever for

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:57.950
your hour of time what about both 76
videos created you know and all the time

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:02.800
that upstream from that together
although although try building that I've

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:08.730
done to have people to come into the lab
in Fiat all that was work to its not

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:16.200
passive now ideas because people will
watch that replay it's a lot easier for

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:20.470
me to promote that they'll watch it and
then that will be passive income at that

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:24.290
point where it starts selling when I'm
not there you know I'm not physically

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:29.650
present so it rolled on its own and
other people tell other people about it

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:34.520
so that's the whole thing is get a
raving tribe without really high-quality

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:39.030
get a raving tribe and they do a lot of
promotion for you I'm still working on

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:44.130
that so much better I started following
you before you ever need money I was

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:49.070
calling you a long time ago and learning
from you a lot of what I do enough still

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:59.060
not there you're way better at it than I
am a lot to learn very kind but let's

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:07.600
say on that subject so you're so you're
saying that one of the way you feel your

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:17.810
business either way is that the
currently working on or are thinking of

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:22.460
working on that will help you you know
just create that expansion of your

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:29.880
business you don't have to do which is
very time consuming for real money and

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:36.330
there's only that much again charged
well on how much how much value people

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:37.630
perceive in those

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:44.780
professional speaking up more gigs you
know offered to me from like a major

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:49.960
conferences in Vegas in April you know
kind of thing from just doing blames

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.210
getting out there in being present
people for a while so my nose which

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:59.610
talks about any get $5,000 speaking gigs
from just being a black lab if you use

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:04.500
it well but to answer your question is
about a sales funnel and Mark Timberlake

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:09.380
wasn't here in a min here right this
second but you know me to choose you a

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:14.190
little bit about how to make that course
into next courses but Mark Timberlake

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:21.240
had a wonderful group or community over
on G Plus mark helping out here it's

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:32.010
video educators and entrepreneurs thank
you I call OBE here so thank you it's a

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:35.680
wonderful thing and he's always target
and he's got courses out that are free

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:39.900
and paid and whatever enough taken them
too and it's it's all about that sales

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:47.320
final so that's what I'm setting up now
that I've kind of stable on small purse

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:51.310
cuz I was all over the place offering
everything for a while if I can't cover

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:55.630
all that anymore I'm really need to
focus on getting this sales funnel that

00:09:55.630 --> 00:10:02.760
walk people through I'm about to redo my
start here page for that reason and

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:06.660
literally let people feel for what where
they are beginner all the way up to

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:11.440
really serious mega people and let them
for white where they are in their

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:16.320
process and pick up offers from their
mom resources and offers from there but

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:23.960
you the same way and Mark timber white
teachers this straight out about your

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:30.120
introductory funnel top of stuff and
then have your higher price things like

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:36.630
you're alive group things are 101 let
that be a sales funnel into it and so

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:40.110
that's pretty much what I have always
done with my video tutorials because

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:44.900
they're the generic things and people
walk into that and then I won't 101

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:48.440
training now and now want a whole site
revamp and then I want some custom

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.240
something rather

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:54.339
and they come in at $1 labeled 1500

00:10:54.339 --> 00:10:59.050
natural salesman at all I'm from people
commit $1 emotional come in a dollar and

00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:04.760
labor they go to $10 27 or 97 in that
may be where they stopped a lot of

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:08.990
people who follow me follow me for an
entire year before they hire me I've

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:13.560
heard that for the last six years so
everything I'm doing today is my income

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:19.320
or probably follow right now this is
probably my income from its summer
