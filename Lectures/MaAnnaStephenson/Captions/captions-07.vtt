00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
when Cherry writes a lot of knowledge
drop in their entirety keep up with

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.120
everything that you think that some of
the recap first of all one of the

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:16.390
important things is that you are running
a business and Hill has said the same

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.369
thing when he first got nine you know me
you didn't read it as a business use

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.859
candidate in Iran and once he started at
like eight business so you are running a

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:33.210
business is one of the key things that
man is here amongst many other things

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.430
keep that in mind that you're running a
business she is providing daily she is

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.640
connecting with people she's training
her customers are so we do have a

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.190
question can you talk to the two styles
for the type which post their monthly

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:52.399
income and said you can do this too and
the type that it may be such as I do any

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:59.390
thoughts on there so you want to grab
that question me and I am sure I think

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.550
it's very encouraging to see that I
posted modest a year ago and 23 hours

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:09.119
you know I made by I hit my target my
first target which was $500 and I was

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.740
like thrilled about that I was hoping
for a thousand the first day it took a

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.710
little longer and that caused people
were busy they have live and whatever in

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.960
those are just arbitrary you know there
are arbitrary target they're meaningless

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:30.240
and then put it in the studio not in the
faculty lounge but in the studio because

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.700
a lot of people who are just getting
started the faculty lounge people that

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.430
are already doing it and I was excited
about it and I go on and celebrate

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.130
everybody's $5 first they'll you know
kind of thing to do but it's very

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.549
encouraging

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.990
think for others to see it can be done
now do they cover the next question all

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.159
comments are filled in with how did you
do this what works for one person is so

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:59.869
not gonna work for the next person you
know it's really there were tons of

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.210
courses of how to make it on you know me
how to make a living on you to me and if

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.210
you go take ten of them you're going to
get 10 different perspectives on it from

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.800
ten different angles and unfortunately
there is no one course that's going to

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.280
tell you I tell you

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.340
if you really want to go take the free
youtube and watch all 47 videos like

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.550
ideas are in the business of you but
understood business on marketing before

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.209
I ever watched them another question of
just posted here about this idea

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.080
25 coupon so first of all people had a
lot of misconceptions about just how

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.060
fast free coupons but setting aside the
number of coupons I want to go back to a

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.840
point that me and just a few minutes ago
when she launched her course he gave a

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.390
deep discount and I don't care if it's
free it's the same idea that you target

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.570
your audience and may have made this
that she made sure that when she got

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.500
this course out there she got her people
she got into her audience because she

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.010
knew the day would take the course they
would engage in it in there would be the

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:17.440
ones likely to give reviews so far is
read your address one thing there's a

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.850
huge deal for free

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.870
huge not give him one well I have given
a couple of free ones like pretty and

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.519
that's the reason that I have videos for
$1 instead of real mom program I will

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.769
never giving things away for free to the
public it's never going to happen

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.049
because when you give it for free if you
if you give people something for nothing

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:44.750
that's what they think of it and I don't
want to train my audience to do the deep

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.359
if you can train their audience that way
I'm not going to train my audience that

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:54.019
way if people are lucky enough to hit a
you to me so I'm gonna promote the black

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.350
party saying I'm not doing it you know
me stirring up tell them all along

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.940
got cubans they have a time limit these
will run out and it's not it's not that

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.370
scare SeaTac its me training my audience
that don't wait to buy something from me

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:14.060
don't wait for a sale it's going to be
very rare that that happens I do the

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.570
Black Friday thing I do it once a year
and I don't do it again so I have cubans

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.510
for people who are already spending
money with me in this whole thing about

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.980
putting up for you got me on a soapbox
now

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.970
about giving away free stuff you get
John people you get junk reviews you get

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:37.400
people who never take your course it
hurts your stats I think the whole free

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:43.920
beefing or maybe it's worth with energy
values everything now and the consumer

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.240
that goes into you mad you to me and
doesn't know how this circus works they

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.280
go to court and they say there's a
thousand people in it when I put up play

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.130
out there were I was in a race with a
couple of other folks to get the play of

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.990
course first they already held thirty
courses so they pulled on all those

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.270
students from within you to me and say
hey I got another court over your so

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.210
they were already pulling trust people
into it they got for free they got a

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:15.010
thousand people in there that got one
review maybe ten people were taken the

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:20.120
course that of a thousand you know God I
don't know a hundred students or

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.260
something and one of our courses 8
reviews and I've got most of my people

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.890
are actually taking the course and
finishing and that's what triggered you

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:33.190
too may decide the fate back is coming
even and you're already been there a

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.220
couple of months and you are a top
instructor Don trip in the wires with

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.190
you to me and I think all bugs John
remarks marked amber Weigel said the

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:46.160
stage when you give it for free you're
going to get those one into star review

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:54.260
you know a mock-up of pop star review
from somebody but stuff happens wonder

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.640
what what I can hear the majority of
them are great people can rebuild that

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.890
they do it on Amazon and other places
all the time they're going to resonate

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:07.910
with what they resonate well and have a
preponderance of evidence so huge

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:12.020
difference and giving your what I don't
believe in that and I hope I don't ever

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.310
have to do it I am gonna put cubans up
on all the cuban fights when I figure

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.270
that out I'm still figuring out the
affiliate marketing I had two people

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:21.610
immediately

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.830
the day after my lab course Walt
immediately thought of as a billion to

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:31.960
resell it if I had it on my own
membership we all make more money but

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:37.210
this is a long term thing and I've gotta
look past just those two people you know

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:38.750
yeah so as far as I

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:46.220
in this is I told her she was a pistol
at the beginning to get ready for the

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:54.330
ride so she's not afraid to share you
know what works for you

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.800
idea what you're gonna give it to
clients

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:03.630
you gotta testings out you gotta see
what works for you and I've done a whole

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:20.030
bunch as you can see I'm just an idiot
and I'm not an idiot but I'm ignorant

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:23.370
about that part of the business works
maybe all figured out change my mind

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:28.190
later because obviously it's working for
them but I have a business outside of

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:32.160
you to me that I have to stay true to
his wife and four me right this minute

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.580
that's not working

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.580
may change my mind absolutely you know
and I'm with me as well when I launched

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:43.680
my first course on you to me I went I
didn't post it in the studio get the

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:48.900
free and I'll tell you as a whole lot of
fun like those emails coming through and

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.180
all these people signing up and i felt
like i was something big but I got it

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:58.229
almost 1,500 students that I have in
there you know when you look at it

00:07:58.229 --> 00:08:04.280
there's maybe three percent of those
students that have even started it so

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:11.160
there there's thousands haven't even
started the course and i cant my

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:17.030
promotion on that basis of students is
worth way you say called Bob kiss which

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:18.380
means

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:28.030
ok so what works for you give it a shot
and you'll be able to learn as you go as

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:34.810
far as whether reviews were gonna be
buying the course of course it's got

00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:39.729
10,000 students and it has got to
reviews insurer may be there five star

00:08:39.729 --> 00:08:40.390
reviews

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:45.790
got 10,000 students but then look at the
course that like me and it's got a

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:50.270
hundred but it's got 20 reviews in there
right

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:53.930
views which are you more likely to take
are you gonna be fooled by the one that

00:08:53.930 --> 00:09:03.050
has to 10,000 but only to review a long
day but the reviews matter a lot

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:06.520
absolutely matter when you see the
record it's actually got a high

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:11.990
percentage reviews and it s gonna make
much more of a difference for you then

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:19.230
if you gotta not true for everybody
thought nothing at all the time there's

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:22.930
plenty of reviews several negative ones
people buy it anyway and then come back

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:25.200
and put their own negative review on it

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.470
people are people you know it's just
can't make blanket statements about how

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:32.930
that's going to work because it's gonna
work different for everybody and even

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:37.130
for you course to course of course it's
gonna work differently and depend on how

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:40.570
you market it what kind of trouble
building are you building people who

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:45.010
don't value anything you know I gave up
working with the brand new site owners

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:48.190
who have the low pay high demand I want
everything for free

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:55.510
mindset her not ready to be in business
go get my daughter videos you know so

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:59.100
it's gonna work differently for
everybody and if you build the tribe who

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:03.610
values what you do they don't mind
paying for their views when I Afghan all

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:07.980
bad guy said look I gave you something
about you would you give it its an equal

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:13.590
trade give me something about you this
helps me do better on you to me please

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:18.540
help support my business you know they
do and I hear that no hope it comes

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:19.210
across that way
