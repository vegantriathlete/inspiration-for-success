website for myself with it to show it to
all my friends and family and maybe earn

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:10.100

they'll just enough to pay for the hobby
and doing something so unique

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.140
a writer for one of the magazine's when
the wood carving magazines found it

tutorial but upheld the carving was
created in people would get invested in

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.270
it and i also before I ever even
finished it it's like they become

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.090
invested in the process along with me
and a lot of these magazines are

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.790
teaching magazines too and have teaching
tutorial type books and that kind of

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.460
thing so she went to the editor to ask
permission for doing the article came

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.219
back this is Fox Chapel publishing you
know there is there anything to do with

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.829
woodworking and they came back and they
said not only would we like to feature

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:10.599
all the magazines but we would like to
hire you to write a tutorial on how you

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.150
do this because it's so unique nobody
else in the world

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:19.459
with doing it and I said sure and then
they came back and said we'd like for

you to do a book for things like wow you
know because that's just not enough to

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.099
pitch they are they came to me but I had
a shoulder injury I had a little too

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.599
much on my shoulder and that's why me
from carving for a little while and then

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:38.189
my business just went bonkers they just
took off and four years later I'm just

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:42.780
now getting back in carving enough I
might do that at some point I'm but it's

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.159
very very very time consuming to do all
that and it will become another business

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:52.989
in a really don't have time to run a
second business in the United got well

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:58.560

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:21.989
recognition alright by background music
beijing goals you know that kind of

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.330
thing you'll never know

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.580
eroded and it's pretty funny because I
don't find out about it until after the

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:34.139
fact when Africa since me my royalty but
where it played in I've never actually

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:39.870
even heard my stuff it's been on TV a
lot Young and the Restless Ellen

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.789
DeGeneres saturday night live a couple
of times in the USA up play in other

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:51.870
countries way more than I do in the USA
but funny to me that I never have ever

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.539
heard it myself

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:57.490
played on TV and Ellen DeGeneres one
maybe Nickelodeon or something I could

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:02.340
pick it up for you know a player
something cuz I know what show that her

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.590
her sitcom and I just think that's
really funny that I've never heard it

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.039
but before I do that you know played on
stage of on the road I did I've been

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:15.610
performing on stage since I was really
little perfectly comfortable in front of

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:21.349
3,000 people know private matter of fact
I love it I miss it but but it's a very

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:25.379
unreal world and these songs I would
write you know people would come up to

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:27.440
me after the show or whatever

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.199
a club or something like that where they
could just walk upto you on the stage

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:41.300
and say oh man I feel you I don't think
it was a hook I made up in the shower

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.259
nothing to do with me and the
expectation is that all this came from

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:49.509
real life because I could a moated not
gonna make it real it's such an

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:53.360
unrealistic world the road it's not fun
and then I went into sound engineering

00:05:53.360 --> 00:06:01.909
recording studio that's actually what
led me into electronic equipment and I

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:06.190
wanted I thought I wanted to run my own
studio for a while and had really great

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:11.430
success with one that'll work that but
you know going on the road with that

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:17.550
equipment sits still the road still do
whatever and I found really enjoyed

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.909
writing more than underperforming

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:25.259
go across any genre orkut explore any
kind of music and not have to be locked

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:26.969
into one kind of

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:31.259
genre with one kind of audience and I
really like that a lot better and

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:35.819
electronic music recording everything
came along about the time and I could be

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:40.259
the whole band to play everything about
the recording and whatever I could just

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:46.039
do it all at home service call taxi
showed up there was kind of the

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:50.019
middleman between people looking for
music and people producing it and I got

00:06:50.019 --> 00:06:54.199
him with that and boom it sold all over
the world because of that I think

00:06:54.199 --> 00:07:00.919
getting music you know with Getty Images
Getty music thing the same sort of

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:04.299
service so they're clearing health is
for that I got ripped off a lot there

00:07:04.299 --> 00:07:08.549
somebody in florida that has all my
children's music and put it everywhere

00:07:08.549 --> 00:07:13.110
except for the one that went on Bharti
never the purple purple God would never

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:19.389
tell anybody I wrote that I thought
parents were all over and over and over

00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:25.999
so you know I had to keep it kind of
quiet a little down and worked with

00:07:25.999 --> 00:07:30.849
actually down on the jingle capital of
the world believe it or not and just

00:07:30.849 --> 00:07:36.809
happened to fall into that with them and
it was a lot of white what they call

00:07:36.809 --> 00:07:42.639
white bread music and boring people been
in the industry for a long time they

00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:48.079
wouldn't break out so I was really happy
to find some of these other houses the

00:07:48.079 --> 00:07:52.849
that had library that were a little more
he opened a little more fun and I would

00:07:52.849 --> 00:07:59.489
just make up there you don't have to be
530 on 32nd you know 63rd and whatever

00:07:59.489 --> 00:08:05.009
in there certain mathematical formulas
you put that into things out but they

00:08:05.009 --> 00:08:10.819
have to hook they have to grab somebody
immediately think that kind of all of

00:08:10.819 --> 00:08:16.459
that gave me a good way to not care what
anybody thinks to do what I do in put

00:08:16.459 --> 00:08:22.139
out the best quality that are candid
hooks people in immediately and it's

00:08:22.139 --> 00:08:26.219
going to be good for some folks and not
good for others you know it just feels

00:08:26.219 --> 00:08:31.939
what it is but I've buried because of it
in criticism and praise will get you

00:08:31.939 --> 00:08:39.439
nowhere with me I will take instruction
I do listen but it doesn't really get to

00:08:39.439 --> 00:08:40.250
me

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:44.620
if I'm producing high-quality these
people that are that's resonating with

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:49.850
an audience whatever my audience is from
doing it in my voice I don't necessarily

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:56.550
know everything I may not know I may not
even be the best instructor on the

00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:01.040
planet or whatever but people resonate
with me the way I do it and there's

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:07.650
millions billions of people that need to
learn so you know I'm just thrilled that

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:14.210
enough people rather than I do what I do
trust me that I'm going to do the very

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:20.870
best that I can't deliver the very best
content that I can and accurate that is

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:26.600
actually helpful very step that I used
to that I checked to make sure that

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:30.660
there's no problems with it I don't just
do it because of love I actually look at

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:34.640
the function of it too and I have a
pretty no nonsense approach about things

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:39.290
and there are a lot of folks who
resonate with that enough so that I

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:43.990
could quit my day job and do this full
time and am very thankful for their
