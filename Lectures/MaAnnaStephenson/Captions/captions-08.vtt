ok I do want to give you a chance to
talk about yourself some as well as an

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.840
interview in the end here but this is
this is to inspire people and they had

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.070
given you a lot of compliments here so
you can feel free to kind of throw in a

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.140
bit about your experience in in your
thoughts on things as well you feel like

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.399
you're stealing stealing the show here
so what do you have to say to people

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.930
about it it doesn't have to be about you
to me are alleged to me at all you got

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.510
your own thing that you're doing so

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.700
to build to build your success with you
so much

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:59.750
well that's one thing and I've been
trying to not about any to see this man

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:06.420
here's what I love about you is number
one transparency and that's why you are

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.869
where you are new business because your
followers more customers know exactly

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:19.229
what to expect and how things were and
they know that you've got their back I

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.490
know you like my back and that's
wonderful you know I absolutely and some

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:38.409
people are not like you're in love it is
as you said we all have to give her

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:46.460
people I'd much rather tell me how it is
and help me build my business versus

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:55.090
tell me what I would like to hear but
then it doesn't benefit anyone is such a

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:02.600
huge compliment TV personality and I
think that's a lot of the foundation of

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.550
and also another personally don't have
it

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.250
need it desperately need money for my
own

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:19.010
but you know I absolutely admire about
you the fact that you are not afraid to

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.040
ask

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:30.890
of many businesses that a lot of people
would have freaked out there and that

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.610
would somehow their readers buy
something from them without ever asked

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.530
you have to ask there's no question
about it but this is sort of a what

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:55.209
comes with the right but you also have
to ask as your building but trust you

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:02.250
know but that's again is run your
business and that's why you are

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:10.030
successful and that works for you again
will it work for every business not but

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:17.239
like somebody had a question about those
monthly income reports are to be fired

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.840
and more hour fyi

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:30.920
you know this is what's possible don't
go on but in your business or

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.900
personality right and in the United
think everything you said there is no

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.950
truth not just me but within Donna
because what you think is good for

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:49.870
everybody now you know in about
yesterday where to one of our courses

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:57.360
also got an email the flip side of that
I got an email that somebody said I

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.350
really appreciate the fact that she even
spoke up about it is that she thought I

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.610
was berating the very people always
trying to sell things to so it would

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:13.130
push people away in almost pushed her
away in the only reason that she still

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.890
thinking about being in it is because
she's known me so long and she's

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:22.830
somebody that she really values values
me or she would have been gone because

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.740
it didn't resonate with her all with
this light on the line

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:31.150
do not be dr. Phil white people out on
the slab and embarrass them I'm not

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.259
trying to do that I'm trying to be real
but she took that is berating whereas

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:41.849
other you know where people that know
they took it is inspiring so there's the

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:45.300
difference right there and help people
take what I do and whether they're going

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.639
to offer me there are going to be people
who were never going to buy anything for

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:54.319
me because I just turn them off I had
somebody on YouTube wow what an ugly boy

00:04:54.319 --> 00:05:00.120
she had you know what an ugly exit they
come with a good thing the information

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:08.319
so great what about to go get a voice
coach to make them think so and so

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:12.500
you're just not going to resonate with
everybody and I just whatever you know

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.220
my skin is too thick to worry about it
but when somebody takes the time to

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.990
write me an email to say I felt
belittled a little bit I'm struggling

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.120
here and I felt belittled and it's not
necessarily intimidating I just don't

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.530
bob with that include you consider it
I'm gonna listen to somebody takes that

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:34.360
kind of time to contact me and I'm gonna
fade Imam being taken no carrot

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:41.030
alienating a whole segment of people
that I would like to work will need to

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:45.659
have a look and I'll beside sometimes
you're so close to yourself you can't

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:49.380
say so appreciate hearing what you see
from the outside it what resonates with

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.990
you and that matters to me to hear that
be back
