00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.779
ok so here we go so we thought we'd
really started mentioning you doing here

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:08.540
and I'm gonna stop dancing around the
whole thing so tell us how you came to

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.690
it how you came to you it's really just
an extension of what I'm already doing

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.240
it more eyeballs that's the whole point
of it you tammy has a very big student

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.510
base and I think it's what eight million
at this point and like that piece of pie

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:33.140
you know my piece of pie out of that one
percent of it just 1% I'll take that but

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.930
it really made me have to go back in
briefing from our pricing structure one

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.879
of them because trying to figure out how
not to compete with myself since I

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.960
already have membership site in some of
these courses are going to be exactly

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.329
the same most of them all there will be
some things that are absolutely massive

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:56.149
on Mon and something for absolutely
exclusive on you to me and Mark I'm not

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.329
sure which put in there man that's kinda
but thanks

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.130
whatever dude but you know I had to
figure out how to compete with myself

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.360
and that he'll not make my clients feel
like they're getting ripped off already

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.250
because if they pay full price on my
private membership site in the go see

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.549
you to be paying for 10 bucks are going
to be really upset with that and so I

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:23.540
just had to get over it and realize that
whatever our market is the price of

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:24.759
those wherever that is

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:30.369
and a modified it really is part of a
much bigger thing that has a much bigger

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:37.000
value to it so I just got over it and I
pushed you to me a lot but for me really

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.229
it's just another platform but it
changed how I make courses because I'm

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.140
to the point I don't want to have to
make a video any longer than it has to

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.430
be and I mean to the second any longer
than it has to be and usually requires

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.659
me to have certain

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.229
show you two minutes something that's
changed I'm gonna do that I can't do

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.040
that with you know me but they also
require a certain structure in my

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.340
membership courses are open where you
pick what you want to learn in the order

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.390
you wanna do it and you too may really
want you to come up with this course so

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.870
I think so

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.590
but I will say that I thought you know
that you know me put out their own

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:23.120
videos about how to work with you to me
and it I watched all forwards all 47

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.879
videos to learn about the business of
you to me I do that with music added

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:33.230
that what books did that with website
you learn the business of whatever it is

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.400
the jury and and there are publishing
health and I went right to them just y

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.030
para publishing health like I did with
music with book with everything

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.609
learned their business and how to make
money with you to me in partnership with

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:52.440
you to me and I'm telling you their own
stuff they put out is a course in

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.049
marketing and it's wonderful

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.450
changed a little bit about how I do
things right and there's a great setup

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.870
that you just gave me because I was
waiting to drop this like in here so I

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.030
mentioned about their publishing house
she's got a blog post about like

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.090
bloggers like publishers but this is
what I was kind of in the beginning here

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.920
homie and has a lot of things together
because I talked to know some of the

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.319
things we're gonna cover in the two one
of the things that me and that does keep

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:26.160
in mind with all of these different
things that mindset hey this is just

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.370
another publishing platform that I'm
going to use and this is gonna be able

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.680
to leverage my knowledge it seems that
I've learned from other platforms that I

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:43.079
can make this user performs so I wanna
give me a chance to talk about this idea

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:47.730
of thinking like a publisher in what she
means when he says he used me as just

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:54.150
another publishing platform that in that
post thank you so much for including

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.940
that because that posed really go into
the details of it

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.199
of a book publisher doesn't care of you
can write a book like if you can sell a

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:08.220
book music publishers don't care if you
can ride a great fall in the care of you

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.959
can sell one like fall all over
themselves to get to something like

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:18.519
eighty Burghardt offer publishers
competing for you if you can come up

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.969
with something that we're gonna go
borrow think about grandma got run over

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:26.240
by a reindeer they will do you

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.870
get this stuff like that but that's also
why the wood carving site and we talked

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.020
about earlier windup publisher was all
over me because they thought you helped

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.910
to market and that's really what
publishers are looking it you to me is

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.539
looking at the same thing you know you
have their algorithms in there that

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:52.430
they're looking at your your your
marketing and how you're promoting and

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.120
how you're selling in the more you do
the more trip their algorithm to

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.389
highlight you out of how many thousands
tens of thousands of instructors guide

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:07.159
that got one hot and they're going to
promote it because everybody makes more

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:11.360
money including them hey they're in it
for the money come on and don't fool

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.050
yourself in if they've got a hot
instructor you're going to get it put

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:22.789
that behind them to promoted and so
people asking those questions in the

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:27.069
yummy studio whatever there with the
clients that I helped with membership

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:31.130
thought that I helped with conversion in
marketing on their own fights and

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:36.830
they're all caught up in the content
everybody focuses on the content nobody

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:43.389
uses own building an audience to extract
and income from a nap you don't in

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:47.580
marketing and you don't you don't want
to the business doesn't matter what your

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.210
age you don't learn that you don't fail
and nobody's going to get behind you

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.930
don't think that anybody is going to
spend their money on somebody who has no

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:03.669
idea how to make money not gonna happen
so we're a little bit late here due to

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:08.360
technical difficulties I had a bit of
experimentation gone wrong on or about

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.009
45 minutes people I know are enjoying
this what I want to do is open up a seat

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:19.490
so people actually ask me any questions
directly here if you guys want questions

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:23.560
right in the chat screen here so we can
see but answer some of your questions

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:31.800
and i know that me and I had mentioned
and I and maybe and jump in here

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.759
