00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.040
sort of pain right so the couple of
pieces there so it's a roller coaster

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:16.980
ride for you that from ok successful
career have a child had to start over

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.630
again not just learning management
system good money comes in

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.609
successful again only the problem is
that the success was driven from the

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:32.790
fact that this institute was driving all
of these students who you are but they

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.860
pretty much drove all the students that
they could drive to you at that point

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:42.420
but it didn't hear that they're so now
you know there's only as an accountant

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.420
in ireland and at this stage that kind
of all courses now there is you know

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:57.820
Excel 2007 65 now I could do an exalted
has 16 course and you know we punish

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.379
them users forced to be honest I
wouldn't really be offering anything

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.689
different to what they've already
learned in terms of pensions for

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:11.540
campaigns so I kind of what I decided to
do was I decided to help on you to me

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:17.509
for a while and if you were there or
sites but what I found with you to me

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:26.640
another course I just so you know I'm
still on just came to do I know digital

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:35.400
marketing experience you know so I
decided to do what I decided to take the

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.740
approach that is kinda have this thing
about that that's good that's going to

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.869
be understood that the Prime the fact
that they'll stay with us we give them a

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:52.680
good deal so you know the next step for
it when you qualify is to go on and

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.960
learn the tools on the same bookkeepers
so it was because of the lack of space

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.820
are new to me for me but Excel that I
decided to come up with some

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:10.970
and I can train people that are going to
want to take my ex so

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.930
that's where the moment I'm currently a
couple of course is launched on keepin

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.780
on you but for me the UT me platform is
kind of you know it's kind of stuck up

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.600
it's not where I want to be if I need
people like they're familiar I now

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.250
recognize a few of the names there will
be learning educators a lot of the stuff

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.730
that I do on that website you know I'm
looking at all these educational tools

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.260
and educational technologies and you
can't use them on you you know you to

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:49.140
music video based on what kind of
pitcher extremely long so you to me for

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.590
me

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.320
stop-gap it's you know built-in social
proof I'm basically I'm getting lead

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:02.050
just launched to be honest for the
Bookkeeping courses for which he

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.680
realized I'm going on you know people
are sign up to the newsletter and the

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.050
only people that know better website by
you to me you know you to be people on

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.760
the Bookkeeping courses so at the moment
I see you to me as a stopgap I see it as

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.680
a lead generator with the hope that when
I have my courses accredited with the

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.630
national bodies and I'll have to my own
site now considering using teacher

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:32.780
there's a few things I'm doing and I'm
hoping then quite a few of them will

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:39.680
convert over and you know I'm now ready
to mark Lawrence so starting this whole

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:46.320
year has been absolutely mental for me I
look Luke's nuclear heirs of John Luke

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.170
some content strategy I'm currently
doing a social media specialization

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:59.739
actually six milk milk social media
specialization is teaching college

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.750
actually makes it so much stuff so
because when I was teaching the first

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.040
time I do not have a chichi I knew
nothing about constant if I knew nothing

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.920
about instructional design I you know I
didn't even want to learn management

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.620
system also educational technology

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:22.630
now equipped hold hold hold he moving
forward that you know ok I made my first

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.940
course I made a good bit on the other
courses too but I'm hoping I can I can

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.949
also up more in the years to come

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:36.620
now that I'm equipped with all this
extra stuff I have behind ya so you've

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.600
gotten a lot more experience has got a
lot more experience because of this

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:49.380
roller-coaster ride that you're looking
to get yourself back on the upswing

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.010
again there are basically back to square
one

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.090
I need to create a learning management I
need something that's going to support

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.400
the tools that I want to be able to use
doesn't really support right now oh and

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:07.770
by the way what I'm seeing is that
really the greatest are already so many

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:17.780
so it's hard to use a different strategy
I know that I'm dealing with the

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:24.950
situation that in Ireland right now
these are the CPU that's not really I

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:30.229
can continue to push i've seen that I
might take advantage of the marketplace

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:34.490
there so let me come up with something
else I'm gonna go after people when

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:39.710
their students still get them into the
pipeline and all teaching courses in

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.410
then I'll see about being able to sell
them to excel courses after that for

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:44.590
their CDs

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:50.260
oh yeah that work I think imma go ahead
to launch my own LMS again and in the

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.690
process I'm gonna take all of these
classes so that I could learn more about

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.300
content to liberty in social

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:08.410
yeah yeah so it's keeping with this
marketing this is just the idea of how

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:14.349
far you're willing to push yourself out
of your comfort zone in the things that

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:18.620
you know how did you already know that
you're able to get some other pieces

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:27.070
together talking about the comforts so
we're in we're in 2015 or 2016 is almost

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:31.240
your folks happy new year and by the way
paul got another child at this point

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:38.170
that she does have a life partner at the
moment so she's no longer single mom I

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:49.540
got married this year and it's growing
on trees betray just after Christmas and

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.170
things are actually different in Ireland
right now

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:56.190
wanted to talk about what our goals are
for what she's going to do with this

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:00.170
platform that I into a little bit too as
you mentioned before about how she got

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.360
into teaching in the first place

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:08.230
based on her experiences with this young
woman had been murdered but the truth of

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:10.490
the matter is right now

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:13.570
talk about some nice figures that she's
earned some less figures that she's

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:19.440
hoping to earn but the reality is right
now what he went back and he wanted to

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:24.569
instill a CPA I still do my own CPD

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:30.869
courses seminars I do everything I have
to do I now I could walk at which

00:07:30.869 --> 00:07:35.550
opt-out be paid about a hundred grand a
year no problem I'll be taking three or

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:41.749
four weeks to find a job and that sort
of thing I've been working now I'm not

00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:44.929
going to say I don't work when it comes
to teaching online you know there's a

00:07:44.929 --> 00:07:50.789
lot you know there's a lot of effort
building courses but what I was doing

00:07:50.789 --> 00:07:57.520
before I was only bill 2010 wasn't doing
any of that you know I work in the my

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:03.709
time with my kids go to bed I spend all
day that you go wrong but I bring them

00:08:03.709 --> 00:08:10.740
to their activities every day by texting
driver yeah I don't have time to work

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:21.379
all day every day I turn on my computer
and that's what ROM that I want to be

00:08:21.379 --> 00:08:25.399
able to still have my whole days
children still be able to attend their

00:08:25.399 --> 00:08:34.269
deputies I don't have to sacrifice
anything and I'm not sure what you're

00:08:34.269 --> 00:08:41.259
doing here is that you got other factors
in your life that are driving choices

00:08:41.259 --> 00:08:44.300
that you make sure you could actually go
back to your comfort zone

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:48.939
you could actually say you know what the
economy is good enough you're again I

00:08:48.939 --> 00:08:54.560
can go back and get a county job of the
predictable income and again maybe

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.120
you're still gonna do some of the things
about the working hours that you're

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:05.639
gonna have a month maybe you know it's
you know when you're working you have

00:09:05.639 --> 00:09:09.670
kids it's like a rat race if you're just
looking from one place to another time

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:20.709
and you know it's too hard it's too hard
this is a hundred percent and you know

00:09:20.709 --> 00:09:25.550
it's not it's not always about a roses
you know this year because I had so much

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:29.259
and you know I knew I was going to be
winding down to professional training

00:09:29.259 --> 00:09:35.540
academies that the bosnian huge pushes
my incomplete this year was also next

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:36.110
year

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:41.680
r is going to be probably about the same
as this year but then the year after I

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:47.660
hope and I probably have tripled the
income that I'll have next year

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:52.000
yes so you're looking to the future
you're laying the foundation for Danes

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:59.950
recognizing that perhaps right now you
are gonna get immediate payback but

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:07.050
you're looking at the bigger picture and
recognizing that down the road is where

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:12.779
some of the rooms will come to you know
there for you with the things that

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:22.630
you're doing one of the things about
learning how you're going in hindsight I

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:28.459
wasn't working on line of people and
find me on Google all my sails through

00:10:28.459 --> 00:10:33.029
these professional bodies and I never
once stopped to talk to myself I need to

00:10:33.029 --> 00:10:36.269
say well I did because I took on a
character but you know when that wasn't

00:10:36.269 --> 00:10:40.630
working I didn't really cold start
marketing myself horny think I kind of

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:41.550
left it too late

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:47.550
how do I get your before this John
everything that I was doing this year I

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:52.480
wouldn't have to shortstop gap that I
have a moment so I died two years ago

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:56.980
started doing all these new educational
technology known that I was going to

00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:07.769
launch this whole you know things will
be there for me but never existed at

00:11:07.769 --> 00:11:08.279
that smooth
