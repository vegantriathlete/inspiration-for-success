00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.790
yeah you've got to be able to make it as
it you gotta be willing to to hang in

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:13.809
there and do the things that you need to
do and to figure out things as you go

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:19.490
along with all of this and you know and
so that's just where things stand for

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:26.789
you right now is that you recognize
while ok here we are again and start

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.689
over from square one and put the pieces
back together but let me take some of

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:39.170
the lessons that I learned from my prior
experience I would imagine that you're

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.730
next

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.829
elements that are you putting together
well whether you actually do I'm on your

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.360
own site or whether you're gonna find
another platform support with your

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:55.730
lessons learned from first go-around of
the elements in your experience with

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.059
that too then try to put those pieces
into place for however you gonna go

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:06.130
about working with these new courses
that you're offering let's talk about

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.710
that a little bit more are so it is you
just gonna become a thing of the past

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:19.670
no I'm not just you know you to me all
my sales all on you to be all and at the

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.159
end of the day I the people that have
purchased my courses deserves the

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:32.460
respect structure that you know I'm
there I will continue to continue to be

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.049
you know i'm new courses I will put them
up on youtube I don't promote I what I

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:44.439
will do will be promote my own site now
until my own site is ready y courses and

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:47.520
unusually or on the other platforms I
use

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.299
I am also using the curious platform
which I'm really really found up haven't

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.520
made money on other moment but I haven't
really had anything or not but I be

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.469
using the curious I love this another
platform that I B also using and I for

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:07.659
the moment until I have my own stuff
ready and I see and I have all the court

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.580
together and send it all for
accreditations see exactly what sort of

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.319
requirement that they want all

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:22.079
I'll then decide what else so you know I
be finished should be finished by

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:26.840
February I am in a modular stage at the
moment on you to me but when I put

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:34.139
together my own site on my own so I
won't have them finished it probably the

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:36.629
end of February

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:40.889
presented to the Institute see what the
Institute say I probably won't be ready

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:45.169
till March to start building my own site
then it's going to depend on what's

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:52.269
required hopefully I'll have a built by
the end of will be ready to rock them

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:56.519
yet to be the year after that then it'll
be really generate

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:04.870
but when I have accreditations
accreditations so so you are looking at

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.329
the accreditations how are you planning
to put together you mentioned that you

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:15.659
it's not just that you're gonna continue
to support the existing students but you

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:21.169
are planning to put some more courses
new courses so how are you going to be

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:28.189
balancing or curious whatever platform
in some other platforms balancing things

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:34.040
with courses on these other platforms
versus the courses on your own you see

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:42.120
this as I mentioned earlier on I don't a
content strategy and one of the key

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:52.750
takeaways I just never ever and it's
just there all of the time and the use

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.049
of this information they don't want to
have to look for they want us anywhere

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:03.109
anytime on any device if I put my
courses on to you to me and leave it

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:07.919
there only for you to me I'm missing a
whole heap people people aren't going to

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:11.859
be offended if they have my site and it
says on my side I host courses i'm new

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:15.879
to me and I'm curious and they can click
on which one they're already a member of

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:20.169
you don't have to sign something else
I'm not afraid of competing with myself

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.190
because that's all I'm doing is computed
with myself

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:29.520
so I want to make my whoever and
whatever platform that they want but if

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.640
they want the accreditation because I I
already know that you know these

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:41.380
platforms won't give me the reports that
I need to back up toward the institutes

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.390
in the professional body so I'll have to
have some kind of my own site that I can

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:49.950
get the information from so if they want
the accreditation of the cold war

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:57.440
examination to become a chartered
they're gonna have to take my actual I'm

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.770
not to be the difference you can take
the courses yeah you can buy them in

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:07.180
modular anacostia 10 our module or
whatever you choose to do so I'm on my

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:18.320
site do the whole lot but it also
examines so we're not eating which is

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.220
out

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:28.590
yeah she's asking you about national or
international I guess maybe ask about

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:40.169
the accreditation with her courses so
when you are doing this you went to this

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:47.120
institute that was in Ireland putting
your courses together they're so with

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.560
the weather's gonna be ruling things out
now talk about that are you gonna be

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:58.900
looking to expand your audience so more
international type you see because I've

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:03.000
been lucky enough to have already
received accreditation the I'm already

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:12.950
actually work with the haitians and they
promote my Access courses but CPD is so

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.710
very few of them are actually you know
during the course because they they they

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:22.760
just don't be too pushed so I know when
I go to them they you know they two

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.490
years ago they said we are you
interested in to YouTube

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:33.009
now the same institute the Chartered
beekeepers have launched in America

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:38.009
recently they have an association the UK
to have an associational Australia and

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:43.080
the Association here an arm and
bookkeeping doesn't change country to

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.970
country you know bookkeeping is the
foundation of it came from seeing it

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:50.860
doesn't it's only when you get approval
levels of things differ in different

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.150
regions

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:56.960
basic bookkeeping it it's just double
entry and that doesn't change from one

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.259
country to the next there's some small
things that are different like sales tax

00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:09.840
are known as bad as we all know will
need to know will be occasions civic but

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:15.169
I do plan on getting credit a show with
the organizations in each country with

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:20.569
the Chartered and having module
specifically for that particular region

00:07:20.569 --> 00:07:26.289
I'm from our lives myself so I know the
Irish sales tax rules I also am very

00:07:26.289 --> 00:07:30.270
familiar with the UK sales tax rules I
can teach that myself I have to get

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:31.620
somebody on board

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:39.259
fortunate to find out online about sex
and dating sites so I will have to have

00:07:39.259 --> 00:07:44.759
small module sales tax that basically
the only difference that only to have

00:07:44.759 --> 00:07:50.110
for each region but I plan on going
forth for regions this time whereas with

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:57.830
the exile I am never had armed 10 that's
not true I had the UK's so how it is

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:04.460
that is that something that you feel is
still the site you get going

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:09.440
international is it something that you
feel is well within your comfort zone or

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:17.490
is this something that you feel is yet
again kind of person you outside very

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:22.440
much exercise video pushes me outside to
be honest with you know what I made on

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:27.159
my original courses it was screencast I
didn't appear in any of the green

00:08:27.159 --> 00:08:33.180
screening kiddo everything everything
outside of my comfort zone but I kind of

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:39.360
like you know how to look this is what
has to be done them don't leave me so I

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.419
have to just do it

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:43.979
you just you just go with us climb the
ladder
