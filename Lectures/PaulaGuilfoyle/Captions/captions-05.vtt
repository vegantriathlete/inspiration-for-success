00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.899
very good and so what is your long-term
vision here that you have in terms of

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:14.429
where you are looking to head with your
with your like online e-learning

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:21.140
strategy in general not you to meet
specific you know one another picture

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:27.599
where you're looking to head long-term
my big picture is to be able to remain

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:35.120
at home with the kids and you know stay
afloat but to be able to get decent

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.140
living our time and I know it's doable
because I know I have to leave before

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.010
and after that everything else is a
bonus I don't really I'm just kind of

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.289
take one day yeah I do have a you know
I'm talking about a planned two years

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:55.390
where I know I make an X and being an
accountant I have a business plan that's

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:04.170
kind of the type of person so in that
way I'm both I still no obstacles what

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.820
i'm saying is going to happen in two
years might actually take because

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:15.310
there's just something as our time when
you're doing it on your own it's like a

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.150
true and I'm sure you know about
yourself

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.939
obviously I'd like you to meet you run a
whole lot smoother for me right now and

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.939
have a whole lot more bottom line that I
to show for it but in a leg with you my

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:36.820
background computer programmer and
online presence in the digital marketing

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:47.229
in you know marketing any this kind of
told him that it's the type of a thing

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:58.320
that as you go and just as they arise

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.860
yeah it is it is kind of like that I'm
there is going to be challenges there's

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.320
always going to be challenges

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:11.900
one of the challenges I had recently was
on YouTube I gotta do kitchen are used

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:21.620
to record I can no longer because of all
my card I made it the whole course not

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.550
even my other courses have just been
approved

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.240
you know whole course I had to remake
the whole course of obviously you know

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:43.780
there's always kind of life and that's
what makes it fun there right away that

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:52.239
I was going to go back to work as an
accountant but that would take the fun

00:02:52.239 --> 00:03:00.470
of it with excellent so it's you know
I'm glad that you took the time to share

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.450
your experience to share your plans how
you dress the various challenges that

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:15.980
you encountered and you know to the
putting in place in the future you know

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.750
I think it is an interesting thing to
get to hear about somebody who's had to

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:31.780
change things around you know these
things were for you know no children

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.250
mountains in corporate environments

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:47.980
might not be important to their children
and you're just once again in this

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:57.239
situation that you're having to build
something from the ground up and just go

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:06.290
with it and just having dad that you can
do it and you will get the pieces

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:29.650
together overall to you know I am one of
these optimistic dreams if you have a

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:38.430
way to get a deal with whatever you need
to do there to get those pieces together

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.449
so I wanna give people a chance if
there's any other questions that you and

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:49.570
if you would like me to ask go ahead and
put comment question in the year because

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.389
we'll be wrapping stuff up here in a bit
now to make sure that they had their

00:04:53.389 --> 00:05:01.030
chance to get their questions answered

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:07.599
