00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.430
so I had a partnership with the CPA and
our lunch and partnership with them as

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.120
they took activation keys all they would
resell them to their members and their

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.009
members would sign in to my site used to
activation key which would bypass system

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:21.590
that I would build Institute at the end
of every quarter for we do projects like

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.460
building for my portion that collect all
these with some of the other

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.939
professional bodies I approached ended
up control of professional bodies here

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.989
in our hands up some in the UK and so I
had a profit share space and what others

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.350
there was a fee for the quantitation
after that anything he made was yours

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.030
book they didn't actively market the
courses while some of the other parties

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:51.010
but again the money was it was well
worth spending so that's how I got into

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:57.730
my silent and it sounds so smooth like
the way she went over this right now

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.340
yard is gonna be listening to the say oh
that's so great oh it's wonderful here

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.630
she made over a hundred thousand euro on
this excellent it she got this is really

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.560
glossed over here is the fact that he
hinted towards it that is she started

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.909
out she just had some tutorials that you
put together as you put them on a CD she

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.000
didn't know what she was going to do
with them and how she would go about

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.780
selling them and use it when she talked
to these people there was all the stuff

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.409
she said was information overload
learning management system in school and

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.280
this that and the other thing is you
scrub brush set to the site here and she

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.009
started telling us about how she went
out to get a learning management system

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:48.860
put together but like that makes it
sound so much easier than it is and it's

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:55.799
lovely $210,000 she also briefly
mentioned she had put out a

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.119
specification and got a quote from
somebody in Ireland and she couldn't

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.180
afford to do that to google.com and then
she jumps ahead ok so later

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.390
2010 when she didn't mention is

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.580
still what it cost her to build that
mess in the first place is not an

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.610
insignificant amount of money it's so
great she recalled in some period of

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:30.390
time but at the time that she was doing
this she didn't know and remember shin

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.780
guards instance who yet the
accreditations she just knew that they

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.470
wanted some LMS and she she went out
there she put together specifications

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.370
she laid off the large sum of money has
put together before she knew whether she

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:54.239
was gonna make you know so little bit
more about the process that you had to

00:02:54.239 --> 00:03:03.530
go through because you said it took 18
months from your videos and yeah so I

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.989
stopped making the first videos it took
me about six months to make videos and

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:14.459
then I had to just another 12 months to
draw back and work with the developers

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:23.090
working with an experienced a huge huge
experience anybody out there that I'm

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.890
sure they have experienced the same
there's something to be said about being

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.790
able to just reach across the desk angle
somebody you know when you have that

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:40.480
sort of distance you can do that and I
went back obviously now and I asked for

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:49.400
ABC and they gave me a be CD which you
know I can't argue with that was the act

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:57.980
well I was kinda hope you know what I
was kind of that they would come back to

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:05.820
me and say oh well ABC into you and look
at explains it would run times and

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:15.440
called their the site had you know I had
to make provement number changes to the

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.150
site

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.220
how do I have had my side

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:29.650
yeah so what you basically did is like
you just sort of lost yourself into the

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.130
situation and i wanna talk about that a
little bit more about yourself in that

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:39.960
situation because we talked about you
are a certified public accountants not

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.840
like you were an internet marketer
whether such a thing like that existed

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:53.470
at that you weren't you weren't you
weren't somebody who was you know prior

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:54.570
to that

00:04:54.570 --> 00:05:01.940
running any of your own types so you and
counting

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:13.750
background you were willing to then say
sure this sounds like a great idea I

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:19.330
kinda had a passion for teaching as well
which I got through that I had always

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.500
had you and your smile we had trained
using I really enjoyed training aspect

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:29.000
of my roles so I kinda knew that
training was something that I would

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.810
enjoy that why would I now do some
face-to-face training as well but at the

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.330
time I wasn't you know it was only
employee training that I would have been

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.210
doing what I have one particular story
about it Carroll

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:47.479
that she she really kind of inspired me
on the teaching side she came to work as

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:52.039
a temp and I was working for this
company where was very much you have to

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:56.199
have a minimum of its green apple to
even be an administrator or receptionist

00:05:56.199 --> 00:06:07.310
and she came to attempt we didn't mind
and i got on really well I asked her if

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:16.800
she liked it and she was very excited I
am I went and I told the CEO and he

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.800
wasn't as happy as I was

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.129
and his first thing to say to you as
well I want you to ask her in the

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:29.419
interview why she's got an education so
that was no problem I asked her in the

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:36.000
interview and what she tells me that
when she was fifteen her brother was

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.789
murdered and the sister of the guy that
actually killed her brother was in her

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:48.789
class and she couldn't face and she'd
never been given any chances and she's

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:52.599
never been given any opportunities for
the few days that she was tampering with

00:06:52.599 --> 00:06:59.599
us she wanted to there and everything
she just she was younger she was like so

00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:07.940
I jobs and while she was working career
plans for everybody I put it on the

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:23.530
market and the day and I spent so much
time on the day she got her and she said

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:32.719
I never ever have I know I wasn't the
one given her the formal education but I

00:07:32.719 --> 00:07:40.409
was supporting behind I was making sure
her work 18 that inspired you know get

00:07:40.409 --> 00:07:48.139
more into education ok so that was one
of the things that you that pushed in

00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:56.069
that inspiration for you to say about
putting these pieces together so that I

00:07:56.069 --> 00:08:01.229
can create whatever this learning
management system and whatever score

00:08:01.229 --> 00:08:07.449
means I know that I enjoyed the
experience I had teaching dis one young

00:08:07.449 --> 00:08:11.759
woman and helping see how that turned
around her life and so i'm gona put

00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:17.930
myself out there and get the pieces
together one way or another so that I

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:31.149
can have the opportunity to educate more
people so so you did it first and got

00:08:31.149 --> 00:08:31.729
this

00:08:31.729 --> 00:08:41.849
platform launched in you mentioned that
it did go well it did go out a lot of

00:08:41.849 --> 00:08:42.169
money

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:48.570
yeah I did and I it went from just being
in 2013 I launched another course I'm

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:55.550
not and I then went into partnership
with the professional training academy

00:08:55.550 --> 00:09:00.529
and we start hosting their courses
business skills skill courses on the

00:09:00.529 --> 00:09:06.070
site as well which were all also
credited for CPD so it was all worth no

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:17.220
prints fairly quickly but there are
obstacles in my life

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:26.750
obstacles but the relationship with my
business partner but just never came I

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:31.170
have no sales experience I could sell a
digital marketing marketing online

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:40.100
marketing wat you know me so I partnered
with this guy leave he was you know we

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:49.180
could start getting organic sales online
such institutes that never happened and

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:56.510
for that reason for the fact these new
rules have come in for digital products

00:09:56.510 --> 00:10:03.079
online on my site can no longer I'm glad
so them two reasons I'm actually winding

00:10:03.079 --> 00:10:09.769
down the National Training Academy next
year I'm kinda parking the exile and I

00:10:09.769 --> 00:10:21.230
am working again I'm going down the
accreditations route will be exam prep

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:29.870
classes with the hope that they will
then come in and take my access classes

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:33.019
when they pass you know it's kind of the
next day
