00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.390
welcome John my age and you were saying

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.380
people an opportunity I'm glad to have
you take a seat come on in and let us

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.619
know what you like to know thank you for
your way

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:33.030
well I kinda would like to know between
care I don't know what your name is my

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:42.840
name is John my name's mark ok so I
guess you've been with me for awhile now

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:50.680
right I have been on and off you to me
since it actually launch type of course

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:58.120
when it launched in 2010 and I walked by
I don't actually nothing I don't

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.830
absolutely nothing and you know the
quality of the course just make you

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.640
cringe to be honest and to be it enjoy
it didn't do anything it didn't go

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.729
anywhere

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:18.909
ok I didn't make any money at all I just
put my head hurts somebody had mentioned

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:23.460
OJ over here usually when I told I was
teaching online my focus was my own

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.030
website

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.630
my hope is that the time judy and I
thought I would have been more afraid of

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.799
competing with myself and you know
trying to market you to me when I leave

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:41.689
a mark on my own so I left it there and
it was only tissue year when I kind of

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:46.750
found myself and I wonder where ok I
need to generate new courses I need to

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.380
generate a new market into my exile
courses I found myself with a bit

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.439
stop-gap death I hope I can see you to
meet this year so it's only really be in

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:03.170
this year that I've been actively ok so
and now this business it's it's it's

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.270
like 11 year old rate

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.069
well do you do me courses are only
really since so only six months old and

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:19.720
they're already making money yes i'm new
to me I am making money bought not a

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.940
huge amount I'm not making US dollars on
you to me what do you mean although I

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:38.220
i've only made $3000 on YouTube in six
months and six months I make that and I

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.599
make that in a couple weeks my own site
and that comes from how many courses

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:53.310
well it comes there's a courses they're
both the first one went up in the summer

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.739
the second went up in September 3rd 2012
up from 21 October so they have until

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:07.099
being up there for six miles ok so I
guess general I'm a web developer honest

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:16.090
front-end web developer you already know
everything about that so what's your

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:23.799
recommendation would you suggest what do
i do I know my I know how to program and

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:30.639
all those things and I know the business
side as well I know how to deal with

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:37.829
people but well as far as this is
concerned I knew I don't know what to do

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:39.299
so what do I do

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:44.810
well actually being culture is very
similar to what policy she's encountered

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.590
web development is definitely a hot
topic in certainly front-end web

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.750
development is right now because of the
idea of having systems that are

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.780
decoupled from the finance person can
truly not that they couldn't make a

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.209
career as a front-end developer
previously but now it's even more

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:09.579
opportunities for people so yes it's
popular and I would imagine you would

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:15.479
find out it surged there are already a
number of front-end web development

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:19.269
course your gonna come to the same type
of thing is policies that

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:26.069
a lot of Excel courses and you to me
right now and so even though popular

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:35.000
there's the supply in the demand is
pretty well balanced out there are you

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.150
gonna do the same type of thing that
sure there's there's a lot of the man

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.990
and there's also a lot of supply for
Friday in what you're gonna be looking

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:51.060
yet is that you're gonna have to be
doing something to get your classes in

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.000
front of people and you to me or
elsewhere it doesn't matter where you're

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.460
gonna we're gonna be looking to do that
you can have the same issue of these

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.710
same things that paula is doing that
you're not really gonna be able to count

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:11.169
on the fact that when she had the
Institute driving students here classes

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:18.340
in a lot of sales for her that's not the
case she's getting organic sales doing

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.490
something so sure

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.719
in theory you the organic sales as well
but I think the reality that you need to

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:30.469
look at as I'm a web developer to come
from the same yeah web development is

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:37.279
really popular news but there are times
when you're gonna have to take some

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:43.699
strategy is going to enable you get
yourself in front of people not having

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:46.259
said that I can tell you

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:53.050
teachers JavaScript he teaches no
courses i dont tony is a third quarter I

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:58.080
think Tony think he's got three courses
up right now I know he has to 320 is not

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.569
from an internet marketing background 20
did have an audience when he started in

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:05.969
20 minutes to find a way to put the
pieces together the ease in the tops of

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:12.409
the web development category so it can
be done but you've got a general way

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:18.680
that he had done it I think one of the
biggest things that helped him out is a

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.990
he's got this is JavaScript class it's
about a seven hour class he pretty much

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:26.639
he made three and a half hours of that
tree that he put on his YouTube channel

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:30.080
and his YouTube channel attracted a lot
of attention

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:38.419
a lot of you I don't know that that's an
approach to potentially could take you

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:42.389
have to see how that's going to work for
you but it's good for you to come into

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:49.069
this recognizing the deaths this
probably is not going to be an easy road

00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:53.090
are you sure you can get on easy street
when you can get in front of people and

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.710
now you're one of those popular classes
like I'm sure tony's got it pretty well

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:00.680
me right now he's up there on the front
page he's getting promoted by you to me

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:07.830
but you're gonna get the ball rolling
before you're gonna find the same

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:13.599
situation to exact same thing for me
that i very hard to pieces together to

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:21.669
get the Sao Paulo yeah I did you do you
have your first course John just make no

00:07:21.669 --> 00:07:28.469
I have not created any courses and my
courses starting from recordings from

00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:37.190
next year beginning next year and then I
just it's going to take two months to

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:43.919
develop iShares course and then see how
it goes ok let's look at two months

00:07:43.919 --> 00:07:49.879
first fall ok what I suggested very
short course first jewels to get the

00:07:49.879 --> 00:07:52.050
feel for actually make it of course

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:56.449
loading the course I'm tu tambien he'll
usually works I'm going true that the

00:07:56.449 --> 00:08:04.180
the quality process ok an awful pity to
make an hour course I'm then be told for

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:08.650
quality reasons you know going to make
the course so I would suggest you start

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:17.650
with a short ok however that introduces
I dunno go find the top 10 most commonly

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:22.589
asked questions in the topic that you're
about to teach and put them in a short

00:08:22.589 --> 00:08:27.860
course and put the course free and this
is a tip that are different from and I'm

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:32.860
going to mention Mac Timberlake he gave
me this little punchy you to me and

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:33.880
don't matter

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:37.579
don't put it into the studio don't put
it into any Facebook because what

00:08:37.579 --> 00:08:43.089
happens is just get the coupons get
swallowed up and

00:08:43.089 --> 00:08:47.579
the coupons literature and as a
first-time structure you're like oh my

00:08:47.579 --> 00:08:54.459
god you know it's absolutely fantastic
and then you go in latex and all they've

00:08:54.459 --> 00:08:57.819
done is taking the coupon still have
existed in your course at all they won't

00:08:57.819 --> 00:09:04.370
you feedback and if they do texts are
negative and the completion rates

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:08.870
intercourse is very low and the
engagement rates on these are key

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:13.689
indicators are you ok so what you need
to do is you need to get your course

00:09:13.689 --> 00:09:18.920
leave it up on YouTube and leave it
there for its ok and don't wash it has

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:31.899
to be free for a short class they think
that's available for free

00:09:31.899 --> 00:09:35.779
you're not going to market it you're not
going to advertise it anyplace but it's

00:09:35.779 --> 00:09:40.519
gonna be in the topic that you're
interested in teaching what what can

00:09:40.519 --> 00:09:45.240
happen then is when people are so you
mentioned you know development I don't

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:49.759
know what frameworks you use if you use
different JavaScript framework search do

00:09:49.759 --> 00:09:55.319
something with some of whatever you're
using for your friend and development

00:09:55.319 --> 00:10:01.069
pick something from there it's a topic
that you know actually is popular for

00:10:01.069 --> 00:10:05.319
developers in pretty short course
together so that is a number of things

00:10:05.319 --> 00:10:08.870
that Paula stone you hear that you're
gonna get one is it going to learn the

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:12.600
process of creating a course and it's
actually a huge learning curve to go

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:16.759
through is surprisingly surprisingly
large until you've done it you realize

00:10:16.759 --> 00:10:21.949
how much you have to learn about
creating gonna get to learn that you're

00:10:21.949 --> 00:10:26.589
gonna go through their quality process
get a chance to learn about what their

00:10:26.589 --> 00:10:31.709
expectations are so you gonna learn all
the logistics about making a course but

00:10:31.709 --> 00:10:34.929
then the next minute you're gonna get
out of this is because of the fact that

00:10:34.929 --> 00:10:39.769
it's a three course that's a way and I'm
gonna play the same game I'm doing I am

00:10:39.769 --> 00:10:43.399
using the strategy right now although
I'm not gonna be a thirty minute I I got

00:10:43.399 --> 00:10:48.120
a different plan that I but i'm used the
same strategy to try to get a leg up and

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.170
try to get an end

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:54.250
around some of the people that are there
when you launch a course initially 43

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:57.420
there are people so let's just pretend
that you're going to teach them about

00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:03.480
unity let's just pretend that it is
you're gonna teach them about one of

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:09.680
those tasks runner to come to you to me
they're gonna search are human and they

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:14.139
get a bunch of results and there's a
checkbox that says there's ways that

00:11:14.139 --> 00:11:19.060
they can filter in one of the ways they
can filter is this free check back right

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:24.170
and I don't know how many three courses
there on your man right now anyway you

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:27.589
want to do a little bit of researchers
have the leverage the fact that you

00:11:27.589 --> 00:11:32.010
check box a concern but so they're
coming to you to me they're looking for

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:36.480
yeoman they find a bunch of results for
yeoman in the Miss LSU to some free

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:42.459
courses on your let me check out one of
the three courses why not you know what

00:11:42.459 --> 00:11:46.769
this is like that's where you can get
your chance to get there like you find

00:11:46.769 --> 00:11:49.930
your course because it they filter out
all these other ones that weren't free

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:54.579
in our you can actually higher in the
search result in that city take your

00:11:54.579 --> 00:11:58.649
your main course now one of the
important points though is as yesterday

00:11:58.649 --> 00:12:04.560
a good course just 30 minutes doesn't
mean that it can't be good as what

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:09.529
you're doing with the courses you're
finding an audience that's extremely

00:12:09.529 --> 00:12:13.029
interested in the stuff that you're
teaching that's why you don't marketed

00:12:13.029 --> 00:12:18.240
you want to sit outside EU to me cause
you wanna get a bunch of the core

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:22.079
scrubbers the course workers free BC you
want to get people who are actually

00:12:22.079 --> 00:12:26.820
interested just as the example in human
you know who's your
