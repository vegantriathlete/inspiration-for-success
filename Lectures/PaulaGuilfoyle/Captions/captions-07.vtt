00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.839
so you make the short course argument
you make it three students find you in

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:14.309
enroll in that class now you'd actually
started to build in audience you know me

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.150
allows you to use bonus lecture at the
end you're not allowed to send

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.380
promotional announcements to a free
class usually said education

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.570
announcements which allowed to have a
bonus lecture at the end were you market

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.760
some of the other classes in so the
students are enrolled in this 30 minute

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.800
class that you had not got a chance to
learn about your teaching style they got

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.770
it got the chance to learn whether you
know whether you're what you're talking

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.600
about her not to decide if they like you
or not they also now know about your

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.950
profile they know that you exist

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.280
into another you got the opportunity
they can find some of your other he'd

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.140
forces another route that you can go is
it you're getting good engagement you

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.449
getting good reviews on this thirty
minutes you can start seeing where you

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.909
moving up in the rankings with this your
free class you can add some more

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:05.939
material to it

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.470
make it make it a little bit longer make
it more interesting and you can switch

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:17.970
from the free class declassify rights
and then see where you can roll with

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.580
that you gotta feeling because I mean
you gotta be you gotta have some clear

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.369
objectives in mind you gotta pay
attention to the date of your gathering

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.200
on their class some people will fall
into the trap of logic last 30 mins

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.299
they're so excited I got 600 students to
enroll in polls right away they switch

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.750
it to pay in the enrollments dry up and
people said what happened nobody setting

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.100
up for my class anymore so you have to
understand how to use this strategy

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.200
properly but it is a strategy that can
be a viable strategy in it you probably

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.750
I'm telling you I'm using the same type
of strategy because for me to try to

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.299
claw my way to the top

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.270
somebody's technology courses der
instructors that are so well-established

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.540
right now I gotta do something like I
was saying to do this end-run around

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:10.840
in the able to get any type of
visibility all that I launched I

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:20.390
launched shirt introduction my original
intention to have this cool I might be

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.480
website for you if they gave me their
email address them emotional call to

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.290
access free and to have a time and
Udinese paid course that was my original

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.660
plan but then I decided I was going to
take this put it on YouTube and see what

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:41.570
happens organically I had two thousand
and I had 50 yard between four and five

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.810
star reviews and just before Black
Friday I course was number one in its

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.520
category I clipped to I added extra
material I clicked to pay costs for

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.989
Black Friday which was perfect timing
couldn't be a better time and it really

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:02.989
works that course is still number one in
its category now what I found walls you

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.780
know when I look at other courses in the
category of some of them have more

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.650
students with their lower down they also
have more racing and their lower down

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.280
but what I found is compared to some of
the other courses that I have unusually

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.440
these two thousand people that actually
took the course for free because I

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.510
didn't like it and they're not just
freeloaders they all kind of research

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.830
they search for this particular category
they had interest so they actually

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.750
engaged with they do not so you know I'm
not the Mesozoic spirit I definitely

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.269
wouldn't even try pretend I know
anything about SEO on you to me but I

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:44.610
think that engagement and how many
minutes do you know the completion rate

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:52.840
is huge on ratings on your YouTube from
my own more than 2,000 uses that

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.019
actually took my course I would at least
50% and started which is a huge amount

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:04.530
for free people to have started it and I
would say forty percent 40% of the whole

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.540
2008 actually completed the course which
is real it you know I know myself my own

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.549
website I people pay for courses that
they've needed for CPD and everything

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:15.390
started

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:23.520
the pay me 200 or so to see this sort of
great I knew I was on to a winner what I

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.230
knew I wasn't a winner you know with the
way I was going and other material and I

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:35.600
see it and that seems to have worked for
me on youtube and I just want to check

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.430
in with Paula here we're at almost 10
minutes after the hours I just want to

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.710
give some indication yet

00:04:44.710 --> 00:05:12.800
ok go ahead john is and it's actually
good that you took the time to

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:18.330
participate here and you know to jump on
an ester questions because it's gonna

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:24.060
set you up so much better there's so
many people who don't care whether it's

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.419
you to me are the different platform I
don't care whether you're doing a

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:31.520
digital information prior to launch any
other business there's so many people

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:37.590
who will jump into this great business
idea without having asked questions are

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.590
having done the research hunt like me

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.060
hey I mean I'm guilty of it I can speak
from experience I know what happens

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:55.290
right now there's so many people will do
this and then the results are there hard

00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:02.060
it's hard to start out that way in so
doing here is you're giving yourself the

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:08.280
opportunity to learn from others
experiences in to save your bitch save

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.260
yourself a bit of that property is gonna
be challenges till I promise you there

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.440
will be challenges

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.990
mentioned about just do a short course

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.540
I get that same advice to people the
first course I did I thought I pick the

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:29.910
easiest topic I could pick it probably
was easy but I had to go and I honestly

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:35.340
the pressure of those elections that I
did are quite poor like it's it's kind

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:40.680
of embarrassing actually the whole
learning curve I don't know what your

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:47.130
plan you got a headset with the
microphone right now I don't you gonna

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:53.590
plan to record your courses used their
heads had so many people did you learn

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.830
about introducing the course you're
gonna have your challenges I promise

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:02.870
I'll give you all the answers and saved
all the hard work you've done something

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.330
though to start getting some ideas I'm
strategy of how you can approaching here

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:13.380
so that you'll get yourself so far into
it in then you just get punched in the

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:23.990
gut you have all the huge said so it's
great that you came out it's great that

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:27.290
you guessed it probably is gonna take
you I'll let your research telling you

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:34.750
to be able to process your gonna you
know what you're gonna do it and take it

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:42.720
from there so they were taken to see and
China a ton of success thank you very
