stuff that you got on you to me and put

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:15.120
doing e-learning things a bit here and
get some of the backstory and you talk a

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.130
little bit more of your accounting
background and what your life was like

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:27.780
prior to becoming online educator any
sorts of course you talk a little bit

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:35.360
about that where your life had been in a
slight

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:41.560
for I was teaching online so quite
rightly mentioned I am so I was

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.830
obviously working as an accountant i
worked in industry that means different

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.000
practice I worked for companies

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.640
I worked from small companies to large
companies

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:57.100
my most notable job was probably
operations manager amp financial aid

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.780
medium-sized company I also worked in
global companies I was in turmoil with

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.150
her I was group came from so I kinda
Jolla they were all really really good

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:12.780
jobs they all paid really well they all
had great benefit but I worked and I

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.260
worked hard you know month then working
until seven or eight o'clock in the

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.460
evening at seven o'clock in the morning
and then last week so you don't have to

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.590
be sorry we're doing normal areas and
you know it was hard it was hard and

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.550
then you have to come in and out of work
and everything else so that was my life

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:37.620
and I enjoyed it and I enjoyed my cuz I
had progressed a lot I wasn't really

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.610
preparing you can't say I was more
proving campaign manager stuff by the

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:47.510
time I kind of came to the end my career
and it came from

00:04:47.510 --> 00:05:02.060
kinda changed in 2007 pregnant and I had
my first child he's now he was there

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:11.970
last week and I took as you do but I
decide to take extended maternity at

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:12.820
this time

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:18.000
garland was going through an economic
downturn as the rest of the world yeah

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.960
but the crash here in our in the
construction industry got his first hit

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:32.030
hardest on my role was Financial
Controller an operations manager

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:39.730
so when I was ready to return to work
price rise with no job is gone that was

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:45.170
the end of that the exact same time I
also found myself in the position where

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:53.050
I ended up a single mother the long-term
partner left and I was at home on my own

00:05:53.050 --> 00:06:04.360
unemployed so that's the kind of setup
as you were looking at here you would

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.950
come from a background where you
actually had a lot of success you know

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:17.080
very good income as an accountant
something else in your life you have a

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:25.890
child which is very joyful experience so
here you got your new trial

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:33.810
child after some period of time you say
okay well I'm ready to pick up the

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:38.480
pieces again back to work and it didn't
quite work out that way because not only

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:51.470
could not work because I know you were a
single mother so they're very

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:57.070
I kind of took temporary jobs I was in
the network but I was in particular

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:02.880
temporary job and my role was to prepare
it was an insurance company and i was

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:11.610
just preparing financial models
part-time job while I was there after a

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:19.910
couple of weeks everybody was coming to
the questions and you know come true and

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:27.050
all the jobs that I was and I was go to
so I decided you know my time in this in

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:40.120
this bed so I decided to make these
video tutorials on Excel

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:45.080
so I put together all these tutorials
not knowing where I was what I was doing

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:55.400
together and i ended up with five hours
of tutorials all based on the time all

00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:04.650
relating to all the examples related and
i ended up with these five I had set

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:12.470
Mike and I had Campese and offered when
these videos which ex parte album I had

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:19.660
this CD rubble like you know things are
a little bit different and I as a CPA

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:25.600
I'm fully aware that every CPA every
accountant in ireland

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:31.160
certain amount of training if we get
what we call TPD we have a compulsory 20

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:37.020
hours a year of structure that
certifiable CPD so I knew there was a

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:41.210
skilled when it came to sell so I went
to the Institute that I was a member

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:51.750
also and I my disk USB key and I went
with my videos and they were quite

00:08:51.750 --> 00:09:03.760
impressed and they liked what I was
doing you know we're both had this disk

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:11.490
management systems management system

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:22.860
learning this is just a disc they were
talking it was just information opening

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:32.959
old so I can do what I decided to do was
put together that's the case all the

00:09:32.959 --> 00:09:39.860
requirements that I needed to fulfill
accreditations with them and from this I

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:46.150
put in for a website and I got a price
to appear in Arlington and I could

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:48.910
afford to have

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:57.550
and I was also about third parties and
at the time I'm at work so around all

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:22.520
the platforms where now so it was
companies like they were charged that

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:53.120
was so everything everything and this
stage

00:10:53.120 --> 00:11:00.980
believe it or not it's now kind so it
took 18 months from when I started

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:07.640
making these videos to actually having a
live site to the Institute I added more

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:20.780
material because I so I added some
tutorials and the Institute

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:28.440
know what that meant for me with that
bTW you have to be on this list you have

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:32.950
to be accredited provider and was very
few people on the list and there was

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:34.350
nobody else on the list

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:49.320
teaching well so I came to hear and I
have mentioned there earlier and I think

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:53.900
I gave you the wrong figure because I
hadn't looked at fifty thousand my first

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:57.240
course

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:00.290
that's reoccurring revenue obviously
today
