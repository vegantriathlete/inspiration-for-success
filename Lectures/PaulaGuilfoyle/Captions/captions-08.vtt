not sure people are aware so it might be
you to meet my 23rd is a problem going

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:20.160
on or at the moment the Singapore
government issued credit to all people

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.910

torture ecologist involved in Singapore
and I have been in touch with each of

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.500
the colleges and I'm co-producing from
what I can gather and I'm not fully

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:54.450
what's going on yet these particular
colleges courses together and they

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.410
submit them to the Singapore government
for approval and they're going through

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.350
such as a tool I just going through the
end of February

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.310
I contacted you to me first and he said
oh no they don't want to become

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.170
instructors and I said ok no problem I
want to have my contacted the colleges

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.800
in Singapore because I had a huge job
and Singapore gone on for a long time

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.990
and I have a lot of contacts so I
decided to name drop and I would get in

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:26.260
contact with these people and I did and
I narrow co-producing courses with them

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.100

wouldn't completely new to me that's an

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.090
interesting thing that end it actually
would be interesting I wonder if that's

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.990
gonna happen anyplace else in the world
with governments giving some type of

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:05.180
continuing education credit for people
over a certain age which i think will

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.120
just be good news for all educators who
it doesn't matter to me or any other

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:17.609
