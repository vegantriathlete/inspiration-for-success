00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.520
oK so that's one of the things that you
started the transition to your blog and

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.950
feel free to go ahead and post a link to
your blog for people here so one of the

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.690
things that you started it transitions
who once used created your blog and you

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.480
mentioned your YouTube channel will come
back to that little bit is well is that

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:27.310
you know you're saying that you had your
supplies were then able to sell through

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.200
your blog that's what you started doing
on your log was putting these tutorials

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.680
up so that people can start to make some
of the jewelry on their own and that

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.950
gave you an avenue to start selling the
supplies and the tools so they follow up

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:49.160
on that just a little bit though where
you just strictly getting rid of the

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.809
inventory that you had on hand or did
you that kinda ship to say hey I can buy

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.260
some stuff wholesale and then I can sell
it you know

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.470
retail prices yes and no because I i
didnt I started off just reduce tax

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.600
basically but ok I knew that I didn't
want to get in the business just like

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.170
buying wholesale in selling because
that's still the same things still

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:22.479
changing so i didnt little bit that we
can I had a really popular products

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:28.740
people would ask for more margin
especially if it's something that I'll

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.390
see you in my jewelry business so the
way it started because when i buy an

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:43.090
iPhone 5 be got to get the best price
you Bible you might only a couple pieces

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:50.119
so you're not really making back your
cost you don't make your clocks back

00:01:50.119 --> 00:02:01.040
it's it's a longer term like you can
make your eventually but you have to

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:08.979
sell my you know say hi during this
meeting make money back on that you've

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.350
got to get the best price

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:16.750
right so I kind of like doing that
anyway and I just realized I can I

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.710
cancel my sex right I bought it a good
price how a lot I don't need all of it

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:30.970
then there's a couple of things in
russia and I dunno hi involve the most

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:37.170
part I can get away from that to you we
could just you know I enjoy selling on

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:46.380
Etsy in night I enjoyed just actually
making making it pretty open that there

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.810
can be excited to get their new supplies
of the new be saying this but it still

00:02:52.810 --> 00:03:07.340
it's not like you can you can only make
so much money if you are selling your

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:18.980
selling a beat or whatever it is and for
$1 eV and he saw a dollar right so I

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:26.970
made $1 gonna make another dollar is
another one so it's like I like the

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:36.470
royalty plan better where it's you make
me feel like I call it my low fuel where

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:43.910
it's it's like the same the same idea as
being a best-selling author right where

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:51.050
you spend six months writing this
awesome novel and hopefully it's going

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.310
to be awesome and hopefully it'll be the
seller and then once it starts selling

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:00.210
you can kinda move on to your next you
can take a vacation go around the world

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:04.870
but you don't have to you don't have to
rewrite the book every time you want

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:11.210
every time you want to make a dollar so
if I wanted to make $100,000 a year

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:17.030
selling $1 $10 it doesn't really matter
I have to

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:22.300
to keep making and selling and shipping
every single minute just to make it

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:30.020
happen now and that's not being on it to
you because I also I don't mind you

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.070
having employees my business i want to
be completely self-sufficient I want to

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:43.230
be an independent so I kind of put in
place that just made it very clear to me

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:51.380
that selling jewelry as my sole income
is not going to work alright so you were

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.630
going to be doing piecework for people
you weren't really interested in the

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:03.880
wholesale retail type cause you said
that's just sort of another variation on

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.610
the same team here and I don't really
wanna be doing that in so you mentioned

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:13.320
in your introduction that you were
starting to think about this idea

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.050
passive income which is something that
you referred to right now even with your

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.150
example let's say that I'm an author and
I write a book and then I can sell that

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:26.960
book over and over I don't have to keep
on writing that same book talking about

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:33.340
royalty so how did you start your
investigation with the idea of pursuing

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:43.390
this passive income I don't remember how
I found him but I which probably most

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:55.380
people who are investigating the idea
how to do it and I kind of like he

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:00.680
doesn't podcasts as well and he's really
generous in a kind of started falling

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.680
and went to the very beginning of his
podcast and I listened to all of them in

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.539
order to a certain point I now that you
know at this point and I learned so much

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:19.660
and I started thinking about how I can
we meet changing actually when I

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:29.630
realized you know like easy just what he
loved what he know that's what you do

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:36.960
so I kind of picture it like a diagram
the circle is your knowledge experience

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.160
and you know and then there's another
circle that slipped your passion for all

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.810
those things overlap and then that all
you got this tiny slice that's you

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:49.760
that's what makes you special because
there's lots of other jewellery

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:55.300
designers and lots of other jewelry
instructors in the mall there's a lot of

00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:03.620
people on you to teaching making so that
is not special but me my experience my

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:08.980
personal experiences there is literally
nobody in the entire world that has the

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:09.640
same

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:18.950
exactly so part of what your gonna be
marketing to people it is your self your

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:26.890
brand and your self so you went through
these podcasts from pat on Pat Flynn's

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:35.130
site how do you get from Pat Flynn to
unity actually it's not that far to

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:40.420
leave because years ago

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:47.230
breakthrough blocking and it was part of
a bundle together with a couple other

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:54.160
experts it was a bundle of course is
really good price and I probably would

00:07:54.160 --> 00:08:04.870
not much just for his rapidito blogging
think something like that and then

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:13.260
they're all different programs hosted on
the site I'll be coming off their title

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:20.770
right in her when I went to sign in to
her part of the course of course it was

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:26.440
you to me and I was actually that was
actually perfect tiny because at that

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:34.229
point in my life I was planning refers
to teach you how I wanted it to be but I

00:08:34.229 --> 00:08:40.719
figure out how do you deliver what
happened and I use and it just seemed

00:08:40.719 --> 00:08:42.120
really complicated you know

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:48.000
through we're hosting at that time I
wasn't ready for that I couldn't get my

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.490
head around the delivery

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:57.410
hoster videos shopping cart that and you
don't want to leave I also want and I

00:08:57.410 --> 00:09:01.960
wanted it to be most importantly it
really good student experience and

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:10.040
jewellery course I knew that I wanted to
be interactive capability and he did

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.990
students to be able to ask questions

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:19.120
be able to upload photos and just like
all these things actually found this on

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:29.910
another rap see I craftsy.com which is
journey for rap verses with perhaps he

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:36.110
is not anybody can just like teaching I
believe that you have to be invited they

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:40.730
probably fly out to their homemade I
think they filmed in studio with three

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:47.760
cameras set up and and your excuses so
if you teach me teach it anywhere else

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:52.450
and I think you might even have some
other plazas where even if you want to

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:56.339
teach in there somewhere else you can
but I'm getting off-topic so the point

00:09:56.339 --> 00:09:59.760
is that they have the perfect platform
that it wasn't something that I can use

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:04.940
so I was I was like looking I was trying
to figure it out was it was taking ever

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:14.350
really frustrated and then I just kinda
accidentally found unique realism I

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:18.650
started taking courses and I realize
this is exactly what I needed everything

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:26.800
almost everything online and so I
started exploring the site and just

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:34.970
getting ideas how I keep my doors as far
as you know just how I'm going into

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:41.290
lessons and things like that and then I
think I joined against those last

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:48.610
October I challenge you to meet the
challenges were in a kind of helped you

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:52.720
along the they give you tax or something
like that and I started

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:57.850
I started that it was all downhill from
there final piece of the puzzle that he

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:03.040
needed was the structure together and
then
