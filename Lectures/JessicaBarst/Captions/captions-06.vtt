00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
and you mentioned it's become prone to
buy from you in so I said we would come

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.990
back to this or coming back to it right
now because you're talking about your

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.150
gonna be launching your second quarter
as you have this dedicated email list of

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.449
a thousand people but not only that you
have students who have already purchased

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:21.520
from you they've demonstrated the
willingness to spend money and when

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.320
you're producing so when this second
chorus comes out you're not going to

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.910
have this opportunity to do a very
different type of marketing than you

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.899
were able to do with your first course
and so what are some of the things that

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:42.100
you're going to be able to do
differently and you are gonna do

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.379
differently and what are some of the
things you learn from your experiences

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:54.460
where you are doubling down putting more
if your energy differently

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:03.100
yeah you said you got a system in place
for your morning just do it exactly the

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:09.619
system and I finally got in place I
finally I've been thinking about this

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:17.490
for a long time and then it was like you
know all the logistics fre many course

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:27.159
not actually I'm new to me which is the
platform where it's three short video

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.810
and they're delivered by email

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:42.049
where you sign up and then you get the
first left in March and then I'll email

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:48.780
you the next a link to the next email
you a link to the next video date you

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.060
then you take less than ever to you and
then three to three days later he gets a

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.369
number three videos 30 minutes

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:08.830
learning basic techniques are you making

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:15.430
like you learn this and you get it down
and you can basically do you anything

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.280
else from there right now in the weeds
lessons in this free course this free

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:30.720
workshop are actually taken from my
world and beyond to like most of them

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:40.440
differently just like three different
videos that does what that does for me

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:49.640
and why it's working is if you wanna the
less you are really do need to go to my

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:57.170
website hp.com eat then you'll see a
pop-up and not only look up in the

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:07.980
bottom right hand corner for this report
I think that it is it's pretty darn easy

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.980
to get people to sign up for something
that's free especially if it's something

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:19.730
they're interested in so even if they
don't know you very well even if your

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.030
website if they see as she does this for
free and then I want to learn that

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:30.739
there's hardly any barrier and last
year's Super Duty with your email

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:42.630
address and ensure that there is no like
there is somebody who's coming to the

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.130
meeting you for the first time basically
there's all these things going through

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:59.920
their minds $99 but I don't know who
this person or whenever there's too many

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.140
packs when you have to make a decision
about actually buying something when

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:14.959
it's free and they're interested it's so
simple email addresses right so they've

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.519
signed up for this less that tells me to
its

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:26.099
it's very clearly for beginners like you
don't know this thing I know so that

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:33.520
tells me that I'm talking to the right
person right person no I'm not actually

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:43.120
on this may be a sigh conversation
anyway there have been sweet each other

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:55.000
to sunflower ok sorry I just read the
last moment so I tells me that they're

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:03.380
interested in teaching and that there at
the right level then I'm teaching so I'm

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.819
set up is this e-mail sequence for the
first three emails army giving the

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:14.520
lesson I don't ask for anything I just
send them when latin later than I know

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:26.690
that this is the first time that they've
met me it shows what I have to offer my

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:36.770
teaching style is that they understand
and there's nothing the polity so this

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:42.180
makes sense to me if this is not
necessarily the perfect formula for

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:50.029
every product you're selling the right
if you're trying to sell ebook then you

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:57.819
might want to send out a free seat once
we got so that they can get a sense of

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:02.650
writing style just something that really
aligns with your product that you have

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:09.889
to build that trust relationship it
kinda buildup of reciprocity that you

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:13.250
mentioned earlier where you give them
something for free and they kind of feel

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:18.819
like if you ask them for something they
are much more likely especially enjoyed

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:23.740
what you had to share with them they're
much more likely to say yes you know I

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:31.580
feel comfortable spending and it may be
$19.99 specially with lower price

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:44.439
it's it's still not easy by any means
because you write messages and make the

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:53.409
sale right after you delivered your your
free goodies in you

00:06:53.409 --> 00:07:04.590
relationship then you can let them know
I do you like what you learn learn and

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:14.150
you are ready to take it to the next
level for you i think i mean that the

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:19.530
idea of you anything you want to you
just make it work
