00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.580
ok we are live with our second you to me

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:15.719
weekly inspiration for success lab cast
by Mark isaacson and I'm your host you

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:31.660
can find me the link grade there if you
want to get any of my courses at

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:43.350
discounts you use this code and you can
just use the redeem a coupon as I'm

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.780
talking to Jessica in the lab cast here
she'll probably be droppin some links

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.219
for you what you need to keep in mind
though is that even though the link

00:00:54.219 --> 00:01:08.119
looks normal lab ends this question mark
since 2008 when you go to use the links

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.320
they're gonna be appended their install
Jessica drops anything in that actually

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.200
has a coupon code and we might actually
work and you may need to clean up the

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.299
URL so just keep that in mind that when
you click the links that they don't

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:28.920
the actual reference decades sent into
your browser is not exactly the same as

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.920
it is here in the chat with oh so it'll
make more sense to you if you go to use

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:42.470
it in your sees it some unusual things
may happen so I'm relatively new to you

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.720
to me I published my first course in
January and I've certainly made my share

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.740
of mistakes I don't claim to be an
expert any of this and just the host the

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:59.579
show and I'm talking with people who are
having you know some nice success and

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.610
before we actually get started with the
interview I want to just go over a few

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.329
the administrative tasks that if you
subscribe to the blad you will get an

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:10.330
email from lab with the link to the
replay

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.730
and I'll be putting up all of the
replays for your convenience

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:26.070
on my website to you would be able to
hear later on once I'm glad we did it

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:37.490
taste in their know why there is so you
can find the replay later on my website

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:43.210
will do the questions and answers at the
end of the interview you can post your

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.050
questions at any time that you ones but
just to keep the interview flowing will

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.480
hold off on answering the questions
until the as in so if you wanted to ask

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.350
a question you can use a forward slash
cue and then you ask your question and

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:03.670
it will then highlight that for us in
the window here unfortunately lab has

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.560
changed the interface we used to be able
to filter by questions and now we can

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.940
only filter by all messages are mentions
made that change but is you ask a

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:14.650
question

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.590
proceeding with that ford says Q is
still highlights it for us and will give

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.580
us it'll be easier for us to see that in
the stream also once we start the

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.060
question-and-answer session I will open
up a seat for people to be about to sit

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.810
down and they could ask the question
live if they want to you depending on

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.680
how many people we got here and how many
questions you coming in just pleased to

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.380
be mindful about Colin you sit in the
seat so that everybody can have their

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:47.340
turn as we're conducting the blad that
you could think to occasionally click on

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.440
the tell a little burnt but nets here
because less people we've just gotten a

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.010
question here

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.360
like this like that that's how it works
we got the forwards last you there that

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.909
exile with the questions if you can
occasionally click on beats helped a

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:08.269
little bird button that will send out
your stream and other people know that

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:12.489
we're on the air and can help more
people come on in and join the chat with

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:21.690
us so go ahead and do that occasionally
and let's see I mentioned about this

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:28.710
question mark ready so just know that do
some strange things with some of the

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.320
links that just drops in here during the
course of the lab and so speaking of

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:39.970
Jessica I'm really excited to introduce

wrapping for beginners is the best
selling jewelry making course you to me

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:17.539
lab cast just tell us about your
jewellery making business business I

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:29.740
started in 2003 43 you the time was
actually on so we can redesign oh i

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:42.840
three editions and freelance work you
know I'm telling you know and recently I

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:52.070
decided that I wanted to start a blog
who teach just got to the point where I

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:57.330
felt like I was working all the time but
still not meeting

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:02.289
wanted to meet and it just wasn't gonna
be possible to me as much money as I

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:07.229
wanted me because there's only so many
hours in the day and you know when I was

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:14.090
I was making decent money but you know I
was working like 16 hours a day and was

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:19.289
hard to meet you take off these days
because the busy season and it just got

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:28.169
to be like really really where I got
hired burned out and I realize I kind of

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:35.949
late by starting my own business I kind
of like the job and so I kind of started

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:44.199
looking into a passive income so that's
not gonna couple years since 2012 I

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:48.879
started looking at ways to overlap my
knowledge and passion

00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:59.080
ok so the situation that you ran into
which is something that I think a lot of

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:04.900
people do come to realize at some point
is that sure you had this jewelry

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.490
business you were able to sell jewelry
in you were making money you were

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:14.169
successful at it but you're only able to
make so much money because there's only

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:18.020
so many hours in the day and it takes a
certain amount of time to make this

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:25.159
jewelry and you are basically trading
money or time and you find that you just

00:07:25.159 --> 00:07:30.810
didn't have enough time to produce the
type of thing we do anything else

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:37.460
besides selling making the jewelry in
selling the jewelry and we be doing

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:42.569
anything else I had a job as a jewelry
designer jewelry business I believe

00:07:42.569 --> 00:07:48.120
selling like the supplies is well you
were not only making jewellery that you

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:51.710
sell to people at the jewelry you are
also doing things like sign in the

00:07:51.710 --> 00:08:07.719
various equipment in 2008 recently when
I started liking you shop no jury

00:08:07.719 --> 00:08:09.880
thinking fines and even some

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:14.310
I kinda started this live shot to go
along with it and I started doing 24

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:21.480
you'll now we feature and supplies that
I had in my shop so you know we need we

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:26.880
need stuff online that's always ask me
did you get that you know what school do

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:37.280
those work so it just made sense to
channel that was only two thousand
