00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.339
so you've done more work you understand
the power of the list

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:13.340
worked harder in you you're mentioned in
the what's going to happen with you know

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.600
the second course and we'll come back to
that in a second but before we go to

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:24.550
that I want to ask you one course
published right now and I hope you

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:31.510
understand it with a time beating you
this question right now is so so why is

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:38.210
it why do you have just the one course
you don't have more courses so you can

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.070
tell us about me but I made under the
plan everything out and I like to have

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.260
everything working just right I guess
you could say I'm a perfectionist get

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.539
better so here's here's why when I first
lunch make words at an awesome wants

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:02.789
like my first two weeks and that was
here eighteen was the day I and my first

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:13.150
email and so by the end of Feb 10 days
in February so my first month $1800 i'm

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.299
new to me that's because I worked really
hard

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.369
leading up to that line and then after
that I was so exhausted like I didn't do

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.729
any marketing for like two months tree
right well guess what feels great

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:34.740
the next day when they were decent but
nothing like the first month so I

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.350
started I took a couple months are
really I hardly posted anything maybe

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:49.680
something on Facebook I wasn't I wasn't
pushy right so next month may I started

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.450
thinking about it again

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.140
may june july I started doing a little
bit more promotion videos and

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.640
repurposing taking some of the videos
like a top 10 from one of the videos

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.329
even and putting it on you to those
really quick and then kind of mentioned

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:12.520
you know there's a great by the way this
is from the course you can check out

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:20.380
so I started to see an increase in sales
again but here's what I might well and

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.650
the system is to be mostly highly the
problem with that is like there's a lot

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.900
of work to be done to get it on

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.580
are partly right so that's what I've
been working on this whole time getting

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.160
a system in place now he's going to have
just hopefully streams of students

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.960
coming in and it's it's it's working
it's really slow but now I feel

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.480
comfortable knowing that that system is
in place and that works like now I can

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.480
read them that it wants to exactly what
to do I know exactly what works and now

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.810
I can do it one more time so now I'm
ready I'm actually working on my next

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:04.400
course it'll be done by getting a new
member that's going to be super fast

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.210
they know how to do it this time

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.950
marketing system in place that final its
gonna fit in nicely because my second

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.890
floors is building on the techniques
that each in her sport so not only do I

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.480
have all these students have already
purchased from me and love my course who

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.470
will be ready to take it to the next
step but I also have a list of people

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:34.220
who are interested in the first place
maybe they didn't buy it yet maybe it

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:41.630
was basic for them but I can also just
and to get the end of the final to say

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:47.310
you know here's another option but now
that system that's what I've been

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:54.770
working on its been months but it's not
working for me and that's not an athlete

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:01.800
no actually we don't live to question if
you don't mind me look at some of those

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:09.890
sure well we can take control of your
life can do that if you want yeah but if

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.390
you want to get a chance to have a
little bit of a breather here instead of

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.709
being on the seat so

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:26.370
yea well one that we had earlier was
about the idea and I don't know whether

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:36.099
or not the Craig you're hearing your
thoughts about where he's at so many of

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:44.240
them left for day today we're so if you
decide to leave a little bit like what

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:51.099
you know what are your thoughts

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:58.380
variables are hard because just like
selling anything you have to know who

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.090
your customers to know what they like

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:08.400
not only as far as the actual of the
marketing and I mean it's like a very

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:18.990
machine like you have to know that
you're speaking about

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:27.849
down to your individual tweets on
Twitter your hands on everything and

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:29.990
everything that goes along with it

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:35.530
me fashions I don't mean it's funny
because I actually work in the fashion

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:45.090
industry but it's it's individual that's
not always true because you've got like

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:55.250
master views about that but i guess im
not even far better than I could cause I

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:59.500
couldn't even tell you what the
definition is wearables as opposed to

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:06.580
whatever else you're doing so I would
imagine you probably hit some of what he

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:15.050
was after their when he got hit asked
about whether you just gotta see with

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.590
you

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:23.560
one of your YouTube videos to your email
so you actually that every time I would

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:30.580
almost always every time I make a video
I always make a blog post to go in it so

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:35.750
instead of sending them to YouTube video
blog post so that I can either get the

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:42.930
advertising revenue or maybe they'll see
me keep reminding you that I have all

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:49.520
these awesome products miners

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:55.680
either during a sale or your building
trust and both of those things are super

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:00.480
important yet rated

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:07.070
every in others not happy mister me way
too long to realize this I don't think

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:15.560
it's obvious now I don't know why I was
because I was overthinking announced

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:23.620
that right what am I gonna be like wow I
haven't heard from you you you you know

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:28.500
there's all this anxiety that goes with
it but it doesn't have to be especially

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:34.630
something free like people like that you
know you're sending them or sending them

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:45.160
namely free stuff they're not gonna be
at an end there probably are so that's

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:54.680
that's too and touch with your email is
your latest YouTube video blog post that

00:07:54.680 --> 00:08:03.420
doesn't come till he and I think it's
it's also really important issues like a

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:12.750
ratio that people are as far as when you
do have something you know I will

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:19.790
believe why maybe now you not asking for
anything

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:24.150
email and then it's ok to follow up with
something there and then you start the

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:26.700
process again I ask you

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:37.230
last time i saw this time I try to think
of it like to eat I'll think of it and

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:44.360
how would you be a party like a cocktail
party introduces first within that very

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:48.310
first conversation or even just like the
next time you feel like you need

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:58.010
somebody they go out with you is a good
time to call them something I think we

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:02.980
all knew that like you don't want to be
that guy just trying to think you know

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:14.340
what can I guess I have to share with
you and that's why you're here that's

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:18.760
how you found me because I'm sharing
this best doc now and then when she went

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:23.480
you mentioned reciprocity and that's the
idea like it might be okay to ask

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:29.460
somebody a favor after you right but you
don't really want to make it a habit or

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:33.700
you're gonna be the person everybody
like you're gonna tell your phone to

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:50.190
your email so actually earlier out like
i say like I made my first 24 hours

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:56.610
you're absolutely right but technically
I have been working toward that for two

00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:02.890
years right because I don't think
anybody's going to get anywhere he

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:08.780
started YouTube channel and formed a
line you're really really really like

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:16.980
it's totally okay dimension and you know
I have that's cool but if your first

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:26.110
video is like your you think you're
going to get a lot of others are you

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:37.209
want to focus on becoming known were
becoming

00:10:37.209 --> 00:10:42.949
knowledge the authority that you have
and your generosity giving it and that I

00:10:42.949 --> 00:10:51.800
got that from everything I do like
having given a nap now you know where I

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:59.939
can get this recently on my YouTube
channel I kind of very regularly I was

00:10:59.939 --> 00:11:10.809
working I'm just in time to make videos
I was getting ready to make a large

00:11:10.809 --> 00:11:18.629
basically you know the advertised and I
was gonna upload that you you too I went

00:11:18.629 --> 00:11:29.300
back and looked at my last year the
announcement so I thought you know about

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:41.470
that so I went back in and I added 3
videos over the next month I finally I

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:45.949
think like just just just trying to be
conscious of how much you're asking

00:11:45.949 --> 00:11:50.970
versus how much you're giving and don't
worry that you're always trying to sell

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:51.600
you something
