00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.390
yes ought to come back to a point that
you made when you talk about this idea

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:10.110
of what constitutes giving people and
how you can give to people again just to

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.589
stress some of these things to make sure
that people are picking up on their key

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:20.750
thing here is this idea of multi-purpose
seeing the things that you're creating

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.859
so when you've created your YouTube
video you can turn that into a blog post

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:34.770
you can also turn it into a podcast in
send that out so that people can access

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.969
those things and along the same lines as
strategies you taken recently was it a

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:47.719
student asked questions in your class in
you decided that we can answer that

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:55.300
student was by creating a video so you
actually answer that student with a

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.430
YouTube video that's something that then
you got to use to answer your student in

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.640
the class but then there's another
YouTube video that you have out there

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.510
that could be providing an answer to
somebody else that might have this

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.220
question were you able to actually be
giving them something as well for free

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.600
and by the way now that you have this
new YouTube video there this is you

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.630
something that you can put into your
newsletter to tell people like here's a

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:27.240
little tip that was derived from a
question that a student asked you do you

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.799
know that other people are going to have
that question as well so this importance

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.900
of being able to multi purpose things to
be able to use your time most

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:42.710
efficiently you can have this good
balance how much you're giving versus

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.640
how much you're asking from people I see
we've got seven new messages that I

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.549
haven't scroll down because I'm sitting
on this one question that I want to come

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.000
back to this concept of giving and
creating and marketing and all that

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.439
stuff

00:01:53.439 --> 00:02:00.079
one of the questions that I asked you
here though is when we met earlier

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:03.500
there's something I think it's important
for people to understand with your

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.590
courses because it may have some of the
people here is well we're thinking about

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.369
doing courses or any type of digital
products

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.810
so your type of class teacher teaching
right now is this hands class people how

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.560
to make jewelry can you talk about what
some of the ramifications are the fact

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.480
that you're doing this type of hands-on
type of teaching you mean you know I

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:33.209
think we do have a lot of other you
means workers are here so you not me

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:40.150
it's like this huge online learning
market to meed.com and pretty much find

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:49.040
a course on anything you want to learn
so some categories are definitely you

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:56.170
know better than others including mine
but this just like this

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:05.060
anything you can imagine indeed happy
it's going to be a majority versus I

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:16.510
think today are still I know jack base
you you do me a hero in the youth

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:28.250
academy or so the majority thank you

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:38.340
versus so they have like this great
support group for instructors and I

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:45.840
realized like everybody talking about
doing you know I like two days later and

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:53.449
then they're just like how many do not
realize they're they're filming you know

00:03:53.449 --> 00:04:08.660
screenshot greenhouse viewing software
easy but I do because I'm making an

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.810
actual thing with my hands so I have to
set up the camera usually I have to make

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.650
the same item you know you were three
times and make sure they get all the

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.579
angles

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:27.280
gonna be in the way I know hard to make
a hard time trying to watch the video

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:33.520
and then making the camera I line making
just make sure I'm in pain because it

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.639
has to be really close up so it's really
it's really hard to stand frame while

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:43.930
you're like my set of challenges that
actually building is completely

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:55.719
different than everybody else but it
really really love making videos

00:04:55.719 --> 00:05:09.580
editing videos I really enjoy that a lot
of people are saying I would be so

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:16.330
that's what I wanted to hear when you
look at it doesn't matter to me it

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.800
doesn't matter with us online courses or
any other digital product and other type

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.389
of passive income that you're dead
you're considering producing to earn

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:30.270
some money you have to recognize that we
each have our own topic that we're

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:31.930
covering in our

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:37.639
in that topic is going to carry some
things that determine like how you're

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:41.180
going to be able to produce that product
and it may not be the same as how other

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.669
people are producing the products and so
you have to be careful about not getting

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:51.479
too hung up like how justice that she's
putting up and then they're back in a

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:56.120
week later like yourself

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:04.550
freaked out about you have to be able to
run your own raising recognize that is

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:11.500
unique to yourself in you can't compete
against other people in so we just had

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.360
to deal with that same thing herself
she's not creating these types of

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:19.349
courses that she can crank out because
of the fact that she may have to do she

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:23.750
said the same peace three times as you
can get all three chemicals but this is

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:28.599
what she wants to teach this is what she
loves to teach and she she just enjoys

00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:29.800
the process

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.979
the issue puts her heart and soul into
it and she just does what she needs to

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:38.280
do to get the course so speaking about
ok so let's come back to the question

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.819
that I was holding here so we have a
question about considering what

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:48.500
percentage of the time you're creating
stuff creative you know creating

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:55.940
products doing the marketing doin some
of the technical work how are you doing

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.690
in terms of how many pieces of jewellery
your own enjoyment

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:04.750
forces have a marketing how does that
split look like right now and how do you

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:19.069
feel about actually are you asking about
how much time I spend reading reading

00:07:19.069 --> 00:07:33.770
The course rating like I was about
opening up the senior soon the latter so

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:35.630
she said

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:38.690
time right now

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:47.680
case I'm basically transitioning into I
guess the last couple of months I've

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:52.849
spent most of my time marketing I
haven't done any worse creation and you

00:07:52.849 --> 00:08:02.969
and your idea down like a couple of
simple projects to see if I can give you

00:08:02.969 --> 00:08:10.529
ideas maybe like a day but it's been
working on my email which i've been

00:08:10.529 --> 00:08:16.259
tweaking watching right analytics you
checking great see you know it does

00:08:16.259 --> 00:08:33.380
matter because well I'm about to buckle
down over the next three weeks and make

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:40.510
my second because I'm ready it's time
asking for it there

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:45.150
and they're all they went you know
that's so exciting to me because it's

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:55.770
like I definitely did my job in creating
a good quality but cited about the next

00:08:55.770 --> 00:09:02.830
step so now that I have my system in
place are we turning out that next three

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:15.630
weeks so I would say that in general and
this is actually true in general the

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:30.520
time spent reading the actual is so even
make in shock they say one hour goes

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:38.280
into creating that he and then maybe
like 10 hours goes into you laughing in

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:50.300
any new photos ready to copy actually
doing everything and they market it so

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:58.200
then you're you're crafting your
basement Coast that's actually very

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:03.490
small amount of time that I spent on the
actual product creation heard this

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:11.440
before selling digital products are
selling products I'm ok with that

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:19.390
because once the product is made in
actually there are aware is so much

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:29.500
better than me like an actual number of
almost seven times more I want you to be

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:37.810
clarence from my txt shop and that's
just the actual income that's not

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:44.770
factoring in the National profit margin
which is also later when you're selling

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:49.400
this home so I would say it like
thinking about doing something

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:55.140
digital products definitely definitely
know that it will meet black button to

00:10:55.140 --> 00:11:02.650
creating I'm sorry you know it'll be
allowed time creating and marketing it

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:07.360
but the potential for having it pay you
back like you're not gonna get paid for

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:11.230
you were the last three months on this
course you're not going to get paid

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:20.290
you know every two weeks like the page
act like you will if you find a clean it

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:26.400
out in the way that I'm talking about
where you are very conscious enough you

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:31.590
are reminding that now you people first

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:35.030
it's it's it's comfortable in them
