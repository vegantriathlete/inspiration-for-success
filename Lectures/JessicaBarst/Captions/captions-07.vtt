00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.540
ok so I did start this week couple
minutes late and I try to keep these are

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.809
on an hour so I will give us another
couple of minutes here we do have a lot

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.090
of questions that have come in we tried
to answer some of them we can see more

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.380
about what I'd like to do is not be open
up a seat so people want to have a

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.289
chance if somebody wants to jump in here
and take a seat please be mindful try to

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.430
wrap this up with about five minutes
here but if people wanted to have a

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.630
chance to just ask just go directly to
our place we can answer the question

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.780
meanwhile for somebody to to jump in

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:41.309
so we can hear about desperately trying
to build your platform it does take time

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.600
to build your platform they did his part
of the process get your foundation and

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.050
plays you have to build

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.160
able to be patient about it do the right
things as a comment about whether

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.770
drivers in two months is a good goal I
think that you know it all depends

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.460
because I like how much are you charging
your product what's your topic how many

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.909
people are in the market so I don't know
that you know that just this is about it

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.909
you can give a specific number of good
goal to have their subscribers you know

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:22.869
what do you think about that it's gonna
be like what's realistic for you because

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.360
if you don't believe that you can make
it happen you're not gonna try smart so

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.030
say you set yourself is lockheed
outrageous goal of reaching a hundred

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.360
thousand subscribers in one month if you
have 0 right now that's probably a

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.689
little crazy and you probably don't
really believe that you can do it so

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.140
you're not going to do everything we can
to get there right so if you set a goal

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.299
that you you really do believe it you
can achieve like 25 or whatever the

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.360
number I honestly doesn't even matter
because it's it's not really about the

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:04.560
number it's about so starting with 05
subscribers is really good and starting

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.160
with a hundred and it's even a hundred
and five that's still it's not even

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.320
percentage or you know a number it's
just keep moving keep moving forward

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.380
keep looking to the next 20 so it is
perfect if you feel like that's a big

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.730
number for you

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:29.250
yeah go for it and then you know you
write that number down remember it and

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.610
kind of don't just forget about it until
the money is gone

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.620
think about it every day like break it
down I'm not going to pretend that I can

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:44.010
do that kind of easy not in my head I
have subscribed one and a half

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:56.210
ok what have I done today to get one or
two subscribers what can I do today to

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.760
get to subscribers and that's all you
gotta do is just break it down and then

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.150
just working you know it into your day

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:11.150
take 15 minutes do whatever you gotta do
and when you get there ok so I do want

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.220
to bring it to an end here so that one
last question I want to ask you just

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:23.270
what I think you pretty much answered
this already so you can give the same

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.800
answer

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.380
get you to come up with anything new but
I like to help people develop a certain

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:35.260
mindset so what motivates you to keep on
producing you to me courses to keep on

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:42.660
doing this or doing this journey that
you started well there is actually a lot

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:49.050
of days I really I just really really
enjoy it I get great rescued it's just

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.320
it feels so good

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.820
upload photos of their finished pieces
like that they'll just be like this is

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.870
the first thing I've ever made her the
first piece of jewelry that I can

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.590
actually wear that how do you know I'm
gonna make Christmas gifts my entire

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:09.950
family and they're just so excited about
what they're learning that's just that's

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.340
just so awesome for me and I'm can you
know getting these type I get new

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:20.350
students almost every day I'm getting
this type of feedback actually in and it

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:21.660
just feels really good

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.840
beyond helping the students

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.169
are taking that might be you know maybe
part of your question you know i'm i'm

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:34.889
looking to the future where I can travel
the world and you know maybe I want to

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:39.199
take two months off and travel places
that I want to visit like I don't I

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:44.669
don't want to have to wait till I'm 65 a
retired so that I can start enjoying

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:51.320
life with my husband and doing the
things that we want to do you know like

00:04:51.320 --> 00:05:00.190
to be idea of teaching online especially
teaching I'm laughing because you can do

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:05.870
that from anywhere and even if I just
wanted to move the world's first six

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.210
months not even necessarily like travel
vacations are just be somewhere else for

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.690
a little while just not have those guys
that most of us were probably used to

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:20.210
having you know just have a little bit
more freedom and be comfortable in

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:27.440
thinking of anything I want to do and
just be like hey look let's do it let's

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:34.710

really excites me about building my

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.389
Empire we're

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:43.919
