00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680
so you had you had this blog that she
had started and you mentioned that you

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.050
had a YouTube channel

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:18.410
yet both of those things before you can
see you to me and tell us then a little

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.880
bit about what types of things were you
doing with your YouTube channel your

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.779
little bit about your blog two types of
things you're doing you hit you some

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.910
tutorials on their you an experiment
that a little bit when selling some of

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.340
your like tools and supplies through
there what we do with your YouTube

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.059
channel

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:46.090
ok so when I started a blog I knew that
I wanted to build kind of this passive

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:55.440
income Empire so I actually started off
just an aide and mind now what I wanted

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.059
to mind to be about right so late George
ok so this is my work and then ways I

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.580
can monetize so one of the first few
ways that I knew I could do was like

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.450
putting some advertising banners on my
site and you to maintain their income

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.810
through accidents on you too and then
later down the road those were media

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:24.549
later down the road I knew I wanted to
do digital ebooks and video forces got

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:31.680
so I kind of had I guess it worked out
so it was almost like a timeline for me

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.200
I knew I was going to start out with a
free content build a subscriber base of

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.549
leadership on my blog subscribers on
YouTube and I started doing exactly the

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.170
same time either way that was the plan
all along the idea was to work out it

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:53.229
really hard for Year two you just see
how plant hopefully people are going to

00:01:53.229 --> 00:02:01.950
be receptive to it and enjoy it and I
will get some traffic and it like my my

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.950
goal in the first year on YouTube us to
get a hundred and fifty subscribers and

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.360
create 25 years

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:16.110
you know I made those videos in the
first year and by the end of the year at

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:22.400
eight thousand subscribers might you
know I knew I was going somewhere in

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.610
that and every new video I made it was
almost exponential so I mean I just

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.770
growing but you see the progress and you
realize that it's it's scalable and just

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:40.800
keep their own and there's a question
here and how long did it take so why

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.390
just mention my YouTube channel and
actually I'm sad to say I stayed away

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:52.770
from email for a long time because that
makes me anxious like it's just scary

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.489
just I just get us to sit down and write
you know like I don't want to say the

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.209
wrong thing I don't want to offend
anybody into sales here anytime

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.330
something stupid or whatever so i didnt
even I don't even think I started the

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:14.920
first eight months when I finally did I
just let subscribers your email now see

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:21.840
ya there is just not for everyone but
I'm trying really really hard because I

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:30.590
know it's so important and it is but
I'll tell you when you everyone always

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.910
says that but you'll get it until you
get it and the David I got it was the

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:46.330
day that I hit Send on my way and I had
a I had one big less my main less for my

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.180
website that I've been growing but
really not doing anything with a year

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:58.489
and a half thousand people and then when
I was going to launch Mike worse by

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:01.459
wrapping for beginners to leave in just
a minute

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:10.590
checking out that it's so I'm teaching
my route beginners chase me I knew that

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.930
I was going to be launching this or that
I also knew that my big list the chances

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.690
of everybody being interested in a
priest limbs are sent them an email

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:24.010
ok so I'm putting on the finishing
touches

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:29.540
interests and you can get out early I'm
so I started to Brandon can you list

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:35.940
them as my earlier unless specifically
for the cores and I set up that page and

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:41.280
I only got fifty sign up for my email
this was a little disappointed because

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:47.920
you know that's not very good but I did
you know I just kept telling myself not

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:54.520
everybody beginner not everybody wants
to know that's totally okay so I kept

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:03.320
working on building that lets make a
list have 300 on that list and I don't

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.670
just decide about the power of setting
specific goals yes many subscribers I

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:17.460
have my list of 100 and 200 I made that
happen because I work too hard and one

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:23.250
of the things that one of the things I
did what I did a couple of videos on

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.820
YouTube just saying you know something
exciting very simple something exciting

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:31.660
coming if you're interested you can sign
up here and that's it that's how I got

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:37.800
the other two hundred baby in when I
lost my course I set up a sequence like

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:46.380
schedule out emails today or tomorrow is
the first day that you can buy this

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:54.360
course so look out for an email warning
email in the morning you know the card

00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:00.500
is open courses up and you can register
and I have been plans to get a lot of

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.250
work done that date is just use your
horses doesn't mean like you can sit

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:11.890
back relax and now it's time to actually
do marketing that I had big plans later

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:17.700
K published that's done let's move on
but guess what I did all they refresh my

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:30.449
revenue and within the first hours I
made $1000 and now has something

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:38.699
I never imagined I can't do that that's
the the moment that I knew oh I get it

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:47.449
on my knees in the email that was from
300 300 email subscribers and that was

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:54.969
at a 50% discount on my course on it for
$90 so it's not like I was charging you

00:06:54.969 --> 00:07:02.620
know hundred and fifty seven dollars or
$2.99 and I made three sales are so ever

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:08.839
since I have made it like one of my
absolute top priorities to continue

00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:16.419
growing my email us keeping up with
actually e-mail e-mail this because you

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:17.479
have to keep

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:30.789
relationship like you can you you can't
you can't just send them something went

00:07:30.789 --> 00:07:33.990
when you want something like that
doesn't work we've all got an email and

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:40.669
we all hate those who don't be that guy
you've got to you continually send out

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:47.370
the value added value yeah it is pretty
hard but that's that is definitely my

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:54.669
parents now so now now I got it now I
understand and I am really excited to

00:07:54.669 --> 00:08:01.719
see what my March number two is gonna be
as now I have a dedicated email that's

00:08:01.719 --> 00:08:09.969
like almost a thousand subscribers on
this and maybe I'm jumping ahead if

00:08:09.969 --> 00:08:18.959
you're asking about that okay well I'm
your new talk there's a ton of stuff

00:08:18.959 --> 00:08:21.699
that you covered though and i dont wanna
interrupt you while you're talking so I

00:08:21.699 --> 00:08:25.039
think it's worthwhile recapping some of
the things that you said just to make

00:08:25.039 --> 00:08:28.289
sure that people are catching it is
there's a whole lot of information that

00:08:28.289 --> 00:08:32.209
was in there in the answers did you have

00:08:32.209 --> 00:08:38.889
giving me so one of the things that I
just want to stress so people catch this

00:08:38.889 --> 00:08:44.399
fact is that you had mentioned the first
all you had a plan from the beginning

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:49.949
you had a vision that you put the plan
you had specific goals that you set this

00:08:49.949 --> 00:08:54.569
is something that you have been doing
for a period of time now you said you

00:08:54.569 --> 00:09:00.379
started maybe so you have this plant
you're ready to block your YouTube

00:09:00.379 --> 00:09:04.949
channel and you were gonna build up a
set of followers are you even tried to

00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:10.589
launch of course and so that's something
important that people need to understand

00:09:10.589 --> 00:09:16.249
here is that this wasn't so just go
ahead this launched the first 24 hours

00:09:16.249 --> 00:09:22.189
she does over $1000 in people see this
type of thing in the studio oh wow this

00:09:22.189 --> 00:09:30.220
is so cool because I $1,000 in today but
just couldn't make $1000 in one day she

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:35.959
had been working on her blog and your
YouTube built a list of people that she

00:09:35.959 --> 00:09:39.809
was able to launch this too and that's
where she really made her so there's

00:09:39.809 --> 00:09:40.399
that

00:09:40.399 --> 00:09:48.209
planning in it vision that went into it
before she actually publisher course we

00:09:48.209 --> 00:09:53.129
will swing back around to talk much
right now another dedicated list you put

00:09:53.129 --> 00:09:59.040
time in sOooo into one other point that
I also wanna make sure that she's got an

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:04.299
email is now but it's important that
with the email list you aren't just

00:10:04.299 --> 00:10:10.100
using that email list to constantly ask
them to buy from you they need to be

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:20.600
getting more time in providing people
with value on the email is so when you

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:27.049
make that sales there's there's the
principles of house sales work on one of

00:10:27.049 --> 00:10:34.920
the principals reciprocity in so when
you sent the email us out with the value

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:39.930
in it you're helping to build a sense of
reciprocity so when you make that asked

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:46.660
when you want to purchase something they
have more of a willingness to go ahead

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:52.610
in doing so so that's another point that
i think is thought to make sure that

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:55.570
people are hearing loud and clear
