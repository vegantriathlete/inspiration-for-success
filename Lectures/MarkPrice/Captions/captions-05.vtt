00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.089
ok and that's a great leader died not
spending more than five minutes and one

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:09.130
question cuz I was just about the safe
word about 20 minutes 25 right now I

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:15.540
like to keep these about an hour out of
respect for my guests out of my own time

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.449
commitments and also just to make it
manageable for people when they want to

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.750
come in and watches are they want to
watch the replay later on so what I want

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.160
to do at this point is I'm gonna open up
a seat so people actually want to come

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.360
in and ask a question

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.489
live will take some question lies but
please you know let's be mindful of the

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.800
fact we got just about twenty minutes
left here and will give market chance in

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.520
a few minutes to answer what you're
saying but let's not have anybody

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.200
monopolizes so here we go

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.870
open up a seat here we don't have people
ok first person in here welcome welcome

00:00:51.870 --> 00:01:06.320
and I mean a lot like it doesn't mean I

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:13.330
single advice you would give to anybody
trying to launch their costs now I'm

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.549
almost done with my cousin about lunch
so I just does the single by that you

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.060
know this is the most important thing
you need to do I would like to hear from

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.470
you

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.900
yeah well the first thing this is why I
always tell everybody but is get your

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.890
dying horse out like 99% of everyone who
buys in every good their courses now to

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.820
get your day but without so you know the
funny thing is everyone talk tactics and

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.750
strategy just be involved and passionate
and your students lives and focused on

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.159
this like any given moment of the time

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.880
post post on websites talk to people
help help people out and they will love

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.040
you my sweet about me all the time they
love people from his hey check out this

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.590
guy's course I don't have to do the work
they're doing it for me so if you can

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.850
just focus on your student and actually
creating the learning experience I think

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.569
that's going to do more to generate
sales than anything else than any magic

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.490
formula or how much about investing
Google Ads things like that

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:20.760
and I'll let other people have written
that but that's very good to great great

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.870
thanks for asking the question if you
want to exit the seat now so we can give

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:32.120
somebody else a chance to be great and
while we're ahead and what your

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.860
questions are are a dummy unlocked the
seat once again here and we can have the

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:44.250
next person come out and take a seat
that's not actually that hard on the

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.780
screen so what other questions you
people have been here is your chance to

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.830
talk about building the connection in
interacting one-on-one with people you

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.400
know here's your chance I gotta go ahead
to sit down and asked directly to mark

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.710
would you guys like to know it in the
meantime I will scroll through the

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:07.080
stream and see if we've got any
questions that we had yet gotten back to

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.370
answering some of us a little bit tricky
because not all the head tag them with

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.480
Hughes I'm having to read some of the
comments here to mark did answer a

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.350
question about the reasons behind his
first unique course he said around $500

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:31.600
ish although I think mark since you're
doing iOS I'm assuming that you had ya

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.300
gotta get $2,000 Mac you can do it on a
PC as well too but I do have this

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.870
microphone blue Yeti which when I first
time recording and it's not like trash I

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.990
was like no way I like guys like

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.920
held up I see it post all the time like
well maybe I can get by with this this

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.160
year's just invest in yourself I know
some of us are strapped for cash and I

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.800
didn't have much money but it was super
important blue Yeti microphone get a

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.090
good mic and good screen capture
software I use green flow for Mac would

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.810
have tested most of all of us and I
found one that I really like that was

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:14.340
very powerful but investing your
equipment I spent more than $200 have a

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.389
professional setup just record on your
face time and don't this

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:25.240
a cheap like headphone mic sound so
terrible and just didn't notice my first

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.539
two lectures like that and students
complained to me like this is terrible

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:35.460
you got so much better later on OK and
Jackie that question about whether you

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.729
to me is promoting yourself oh actually
here's a really good point that we

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:46.249
didn't explicitly address here is about
you to these promotions and whether

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:54.469
you're opted out so that's a question I
get asked a lot of times to like do I

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:56.629
turn off promotion as do i turn them on

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:01.300
well I had nothing nothing at all not
one student so I turned them all I don't

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.599
care if you give me fifty cents just
turn it on and I and I just did my work

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:14.089
as well to solve all of them on which
yes the reality is 90% of my coop might

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:19.360
start my cells are $10 cells you know
that's just the way it is and but in the

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.389
beginning

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:26.349
ninety percent of all the cells came
from him from my efforts so far post

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:29.580
things like that which increased my
rankings my reviews increased my

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.960
rankings I started getting more organics
and I'm at a point now where I can't

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.909
compete with Udinese cells because
they're all over the place and by the

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:43.689
way make a great course cuz I just got
on the iPhone the iPhone and Android out

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:49.180
about a week ago and my cells have
increased by 30% just by being on that

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:54.289
on that out so make sure you make
something that's really high quality so

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:57.860
you can put it on the mobile app that's
been I've been blown away I wish they

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.580
would have done that from the beginning
but they only do it

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:05.569
update because in-app purchases and
Apple doesn't allow digital cells

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:11.649
without taking a cut so anyway and right
now it's it's mostly mostly all you know

00:06:11.649 --> 00:06:17.819
me i've been approached by a couple
other vendors while one right now it's a

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:21.300
process that also now selling my course
and by the way it's called stack social

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.660
you've heard of it or not

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:28.430
they they say they still love you mean
structures and $1 courses for you people

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:33.750
like that so but all my promotions are
on my strategy from here going out is is

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.240
really I'm just gonna focus on unity
platform get a new course out every to

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:42.240
every two months or so and based based
on my numbers and sells things I'm

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:47.800
anticipating a 30 percent increase per
month and a half or so so long as I

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:52.230
stick to that plan versus I could opt
out of all of you to me and focus like

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:55.210
Google advertising my website and things
like that but I'm going to embrace you

00:06:55.210 --> 00:07:00.910
to me and and just be a part of it and
it's all that volume sells for them and

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:05.940
I believe that are like $10,000 and
other products that are way more

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:10.370
expensive if you can get like
world-class education for $10 whatever

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:14.470
you tell if I can use the business
models might manage not complain about

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:19.970
me getting those $10 coupon sorry this
affiliate link took my cell you know it

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:24.290
happens I'm just embracing it all and
and pushing forward getting courses out

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:32.150
to help people get more courses ok and
so awesome more specifically address a

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:36.300
pointed question is you to me promoting
your courses are you right now

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:43.750
yeah yeah I i me as as we speak I 15
notification that popped up from front

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:48.060
I'm not even doing their their cells
there there whatever they're doing right

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:52.080
now so they are promoting my party I
every single promotion turned on

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:59.690
affiliates everything ok and as far as I
guess the answer to the question do you

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:05.520
use a billion market is so he is signed
into the programs in you know folks just

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:10.210
by the way they when you want to talk
about the affiliates I know some people

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:13.660
get upset about affiliates and that's
not fair I don't think I percent of the

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:14.750
sale

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:21.840
you're looking in one of the affiliates
right now and when marks course goes up

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:28.090
goes up on my site and I've got the
links I put in there they're gonna be

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:32.169
wrapped in my affiliate links in you
know Mark knows that going into an

00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:32.990
incident

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:35.219
that surgeons
