00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.029
ya in a 10% review rate is pretty good
actually pretty typical I knew jimmy is

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:13.870
somewhere in the 2% range pretty much so
yes market mentioned earlier these gots

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:20.850
some were on board thousands dunes 4307
reviews but just call it ten percent in

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.039
the range nine or 10 percent which is is
quite good it is definitely an

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:34.020
indication that he's connecting with you
know with his wounds so I want you to

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.800
elaborate a little bit more you kind of
said it about you know everything that

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.110
was in your mind that look when we were
talking prior to the interview there's

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.420
another point you mentioned to me about
how do you differentiate the way that

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.750
you teach people coatings and tell
people about like what you're helping

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.420
them to learn to judge you mentioned
you're teaching them with the idea that

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.070
they're gonna be able to get a job at it
but what are you teaching them in a way

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:12.110
what are they learning from showing them
this is my personal belief in its not

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.490
enough for everybody but I dunno I don't
believe in in scripting and writing

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.299
perfect lessons i believe i believe and
I don't exist coating related or just

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.250
teaching in general but I believe in
people can see it I have it all planned

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.189
out but when people can see you go
through the process and how your brain

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:35.820
thinks and how you actually approaching
solve problems that's that's what really

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.070
retains of people so so I'll be in the
lobby in these lessons and I'll be

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.810
sitting there like oh my gosh this is a
common mistake everyone listen up right

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.420
now this is one of the biggest mistakes
you could ever make don't ever do this

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.729
if I do you do something to strangle you
I say things like that in my video but

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.399
anyway there's very specific points that
I feel strongly about that are going to

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.700
help them and I want them to listen to
so i i try and keep it very engaging and

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.479
effective in the sense of listen up this
is what's going to help you not okay

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.970
first you are going to do this and next
you are going to do that

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:19.480
and by the way online courses have a
reputation for being very boring and not

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.810
well done so I worked my butt off to
make it as fun as possible I even come

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.220
up with bad jokes before I even start my
forces I make fun of myself I make fun

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.940
of those blue Subaru is with the gold
rims you see driving around everywhere I

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.990
make fun of all kinds of things and it's
funny people message me like a month in

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.270
advance for months later they like that
so funny I I know that you're talking

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.360
about and I can do you know you're
talking about I recorded this like two

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.200
months ago but people they laughed up
there but 1 a.m. studying they have

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.880
full-time jobs I'm about 1 a.m. study
gotta make it exciting so I make it as

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.570
interactive as possible and effective as
possible without wasting everyone's time

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.680
so it's a good experience for everybody

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:10.860
yes so what are the things that you're
bringing into this year is that it's not

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.270
just a matter of in this doesn't only
apply to programming courses is not just

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.410
a matter of Lake Road repetition like
monkey see monkey do you like doing this

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:27.400
do that do that you know do this next
thing boom in now therefore you are an

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.640
expert in I don't care whether it's
programming or whatever the topics that

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.120
you teaching is that it's more about
understanding the thought process that

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:51.780
you need to use the Y with the topic
that you're teaching so that's one of

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:58.820
the ways that differentiated what else
can you tell people about some of the

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:04.710
things you know any additional making
your courses

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:13.780
use you know best-in-class that's just
help them and this is for everybody I

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.820
don't care who you are but I i have
responded pretty much everybody there's

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:26.890
nobody that I miss that respond respond
to everybody you know what I do I go on

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.550
to occasionally I go onto especially the
beginning to the Union me when you look

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.850
at all your student loan people have
like made like 10 percent progress I

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.720
personal message on like a good job this
is progress how's your house your

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.930
learning going how's it going you know
sending these messages don't forget to

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.770
join the chat room or here I personally
talking to these people all the time

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.950
like my and I I keep my phone and
everything nearby me so I can do it

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.170
quickly without wasting time without
taking too much time so I'm just always

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:00.940
interacting with the students and and
the people and I don't think anyone else

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:06.440
is doing that like in my field and the
competitors you know online chat rooms I

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.450
just really helping the students as they
come to me for career advice and I'm

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.440
like hey you should do this don't do
this you know take care of this is legal

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:20.490
issues around that like I just human
beings I talk to them and you know i i

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.240
really probably was doing is just the
level of commitment I have to everyone

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.970
success and it doesn't take as much time
as you would think some people probably

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.880
think well I don't have time for that
but it's not it's not that bad I'm still

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.470
recording and doing this whole time now
so I'm recording when I wasn't doing it

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:41.400
full time I was still recording and
answering questions it's so I thought I

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.270
feel strongly that that's one of the big
the big things out there also my courses

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.070
in the beginning it was a learning
process also my first few videos audio

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:54.590
and video weren't great but here's
something very valuable that I want

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.740
everyone and I believe so much

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.190
high-quality screen recordings and you
better be in your videos like talk to

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.590
the students look at the camera

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:09.910
yeah talk to them you know what's going
on how's it going you know like a brady

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.200
hope you're still listening you know
ready for us like talk to your students

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.270
get interactive he says he sure is
listening

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:23.780
and beyond the camera I people seriously
every every few days

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:29.510
best friends mark I want to be your
friend but it's because I'm talking to

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:34.260
them on the camera all the time and it's
more exciting so definitely be in your

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.650
videos

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:40.840
who cares if you mess up you know as
soon as we get too uptight about cutting

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.790
out the arms and all those things you
know I think people want to see that

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:47.900
your real human being and that you're
actually doing this your life because

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.990
anybody can read my chart you know they
want to see you doing in real life so I

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:55.110
think that's another very important
thing is I try and actually even though

00:06:55.110 --> 00:07:04.210
I'm not there I am there ok you know I
go back to something cuz I kind of

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:07.150
glossed over it when you had mentioned
before and I dunno I just realized that

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:11.200
I hadn't highlighted when you were
starting out and you talked about how

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:17.280
you how you hit the pavement in you
mentioned you know did you do any in

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:23.140
person when you were getting started
with with doing these courses I know

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:28.050
they had experience with him but I like
what did you do any type of marketing

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:31.720
where you were doing face-to-face
anybody you know what's really

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.380
interesting is the state of Utah is very
big on networking and in person

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:41.820
marketing like despite how excited I
found an introvert really want to get

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:48.680
out anyway I did nothing like I really
did nothing is it all just on the

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.270
internet just everything just you use my
time wisely
