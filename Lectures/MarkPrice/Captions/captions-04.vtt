00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.960
yeah so I mean you're here so so couple
things that you can audience can pick up

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.740
from this is that so first of all we're
here we're just having fun

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.650
Marcus got lots of energy he's having
fun on screen here but he's telling you

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:24.340
like in a modestly he friended him on
Facebook in OC stuff that he opposed and

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:31.710
like in real life like in his private
life mark kind of likes to keep you know

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.129
little a little quieter little more give
me my space in yet he doesn't have to be

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.410
that same person when he's doing his
teacher stuff on YouTube he's able to

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.000
get out there he connects with them you
know lots of energy so that's one point

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.660
that say the connection in the build a
community like I like I'm more of an

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:02.140
introvert and that's not my thing does
not really marks thing in everyday life

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.650
either but for his teaching that he's
doing and I'm not suggesting that he's

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.020
thinking it is justice is a different
side of him what he's doing is teaching

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.810
stuff so that's one point is that
anybody can do this and then the other

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:21.470
pointed remarks said is that he wasn't
getting out in person he's doing all

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:28.270
this stuff on the internet so it doesn't
really matter where in the world you are

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.909
all you needed to interconnect you can
do the same thing I see that jackie was

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.960
asked about this later I'm glad you
brought that up because that wasn't that

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:48.130
was your like my mind is that we mention
this idea what's really really really

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.290
really really really important and every
single YouTube instructor should be

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.479
doing this you just better do this and
thought leadership is the idea of I have

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:05.740
leadership in an idea or an area of
focus or a knowledge and I want to be a

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.640
leader in that area of focus and this
applies to everything like

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.090
like go outside of programming for
instance think of if you if you had two

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.680
courses on you know there's lots of
course as on psychology are helping

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.830
people overcome anxiety things like that

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.740
imagine if you had a community of 50,000
people who you were helping all the time

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.260
on Twitter on Facebook everywhere

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.880
giving out thoughts atop knowledge and
news in that area things are helping

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.030
people in their lives all the time you
are becoming a thought leader people

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.610
respect to the trust you they love you
because you're educating them when you

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.560
help somebody become smarter when you
help somebody improve their life you are

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.709
becoming a leader and you are helping
people install it is so incredibly

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.850
important this is the number one
marketing strategy I have I'm sure why I

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.050
know this is a big question do you do
Google ad and by the way I've done every

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.310
single ad campaign under the Sun just so
you know but my number one focus right

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.060
now on building up my business is
thought leadership which in turn build

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.810
up my community and that is me being on
Twitter on Facebook on LinkedIn

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:19.260
even on my website continue posting top
news up for me it's news articles on iOS

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.299
development new tricks and tips how to
how to market your apps just built a nap

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.140
how do you market it how do you make
money off of that how do you get a job

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.630
things that are going to directly impact
you don't just post junk and things like

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.690
that those things that are going to
directly improve your audience is life

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.530
on the very specific thing that you're
becoming a thought leader in and this is

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.700
the reason why I every single day

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.140
have recruiters and people asking me to
come work for them it's not because I'm

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.470
better than anyone else i'm not i'm not
the most amazing program in the world

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.130
but I'm like out there and so people
like we want this guy he's a leader in

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.690
his area and you could do with anything
from

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.530
how to train your dog or whatever you
can build a community around yourself

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.720
and your name so you are the go-to
person for your people when when they

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.060
want something to buy from you every
single time because they trust you they

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.070
love you and becomes a lot better than
some deals website that selling until

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.590
you sell them something they gonna
believe in you thought leader and that's

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.930
my number 10 guests with all my money
and time is going to be going for

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:23.600
marketing

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:33.240
very good so that again it's high since
his approach this building community and

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.400
connect with the people and as well as
the idea of connecting on an emotional

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:44.420
level what Mark said here is when he
wants to sell something because he built

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.690
his community because he's established
himself as a leader

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.500
people are going to purchase from him as
opposed to like just looking at some

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:58.080
deals site to buy something but another
reason it they're purchasing from marc

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.360
is that they're purchasing from Mark

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.600
it smart they know Mark he's connected
with them on an emotional level

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:13.670
got a reason to buy something from him
as opposed to just buying it any old

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:21.140
place I'm gonna go back into the
questions we did have a question from

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:27.710
Ross year and he was asking about the
ability to go beyond 121 relationships

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.740
to establish learning groups to scale
your effort and then he also asked about

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.320
cross promoting your courses I might get
a little bit of follow up on that ross

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.180
and Mark me as well but I think market
talk to the idea about this going beyond

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:48.380
one-to-one relationships and hinted that
a little bit again mark talk a little

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:53.030
bit about how you even though you won't
connect on the emotional level that

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:58.190
connection like how you're able to
utilize your time you leverage your time

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:06.110
or by having so well so there's there's
more to it but this is a video is right

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:11.040
there were making you know you want to
watch over and over so so you know

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.730
what's really interesting is how many of
you love watching Jimmy Fallon or think

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:19.120
he's the funniest guy in the world in
like just love him I love listening to

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.350
him you know he's a cool guy tonight
show you guys I've ever seen that maybe

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.440
United States I don't have a downside
but anyway we loved him and respected

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:31.410
him and we don't even know the guy ok so
if you can

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:35.020
first demonstrate trust in your video
like your connect with them that you

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.849
care about people you've already got

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:40.800
that connection with your suit in the
connections there and they're seeing you

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.999
on camera the whole time

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:50.110
ok and secondly there's no talking about
11 I'm not sure I'll ever stop doing

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.490
that even when I get real big enough to
make provisions and maybe get some ta to

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.629
help me and things like that but the
level of one-on-one commitment I'm never

00:06:56.629 --> 00:07:01.059
going to get rid of because education
were all involved in education so how

00:07:01.059 --> 00:07:05.839
can you educate people without like
really being involved I just feel like

00:07:05.839 --> 00:07:09.860
it's harder now I'm not saying that
people can't be educated just from

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:14.080
watching your videos but we're teachers
like let's teach people and that should

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.199
never go away

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:20.800
ever and ever get rid of it I will
always provide one-on-one whether it's

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.689
near me paying people to help me out

00:07:22.689 --> 00:07:26.659
they don't have enough time for it I
believe that the students need that I am

00:07:26.659 --> 00:07:30.509
never get rid of that so and the
community help so they help each other

00:07:30.509 --> 00:07:38.429
that's all part of it as well to know
that answer the question are not okay so

00:07:38.429 --> 00:07:40.909
it's a combination

00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:47.319
there's a certain amount of building a
community support each other and at the

00:07:47.319 --> 00:07:52.249
same time marketing but like I'm the
teacher in I'm 21 and I want them to

00:07:52.249 --> 00:07:58.240
know and I can't really disappear behind
the scenes because I want them to have

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:04.300
that connection with me and so you know
I've got a recognized that I do need to

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:09.809
be out there but the nice thing is that
it gets it gets leverage to gets

00:08:09.809 --> 00:08:14.279
multiplied because he is selling digital
products it's not quite the same as if

00:08:14.279 --> 00:08:18.300
you're trying to do something one-on-one
coaching or whatever you can only

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:23.259
coached the one person at a time when
you put something into the digital even

00:08:23.259 --> 00:08:27.519
when you're doing some of this
one-on-one so when he does it in a form

00:08:27.519 --> 00:08:33.979
like this get ur people can see that
he's hoping somebody else out and that

00:08:33.979 --> 00:08:41.380
creates a good feeling for them and at
the same time at 11 when somebody asks

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:43.320
the question they're probably not the
only one

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:53.950
and so it probably is about five minutes
away so I don't spend more than five

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:58.450
minutes on any one problem and I never
need more than that but I don't spend

00:08:58.450 --> 00:08:59.610
more than that on any questions
