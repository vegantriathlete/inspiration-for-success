right to the good stuff I'm sure but I
always like to make sure that people get

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.819
a chance to get a little bit of the
backstory on people before we live since

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:12.450
that so what you said you did some stuff
experience with teaching at a coating

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.070
tell us about some of the stuff that you
done with your program your prior

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:21.720
teaching experience yeah I did it was
called coating campus fantastic people

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:28.030
really great experience and I was I was
there and I was developing curriculum

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.220
for iOS four angular teaching
development iOS development and I

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:39.400
realize that I had the ability to help
people change their lives through on

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.850
through education and we started to
promote education online many people

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.690
from all over the world and I realize I
was good at it but I also realized I

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.840
wanted to I wanted to money doing it
just realized I forgot to turn on my

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:02.739
stop talking so anyway I talked for a
while and then I heard you know me from

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:09.769
another successful instructor who lives
here in Utah as well and I saw him on

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.740
his story on the news and I was like
what is you to me and so I looked it up

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.870
and I was like this is what I gotta do
and so I just went to the ground and

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:26.930
released thirty five hour course and it
took us back story nice people off a

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:35.740
little bit I know you're just dying to
hear some tell us so successful in my

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:48.710
promise we'll get to it so you mentioned
that you had done some applications of

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.890
us a little bit about some of the types
of applications you develop in

00:04:52.890 --> 00:05:00.570
sure well back in 2007 I was a manager
business manager drug testing company

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:06.390
and basically people would go to prison
and then they'd get out these are

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.720
harmless criminals and they had to drug
test in order to stay out of prison and

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.380
so we take like three thousand dollars
in a day we're all riding this by hand

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.470
and I was like this is madness and I
don't know anything about anything

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:23.850
related to software and so I was like
I'm gonna fix these problems I went down

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:28.650
to the call Microsoft Access database we
got signature pads in mentally

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:34.440
biometrics and people can digitally sign
and print labels and automated the

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.310
process and then one day songs like I
wanna pay you to do this I was like ok

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:47.120
and I did when I was a program at the
time and then the App Store came out

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.630
with with Apple iOS and I saw people
making million dollars left and right

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:57.090
here and there's the App Store gold rush
and this is really cool and so I kind of

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:02.440
a four-year plan development of myself
sort of releasing apps one after the

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.250
other

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:08.170
ordered really trashy apps better and
better and then plots people start to

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:12.580
want to pay me to do that as well I
started my own consulting company where

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:19.620
we would build mobile apps for clients
and they pay a lot of money and I am on

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.580
the App Store helping out and did that
for a few years before I realized

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.750
Consulting is incredibly stressful

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:29.820
more more money to deal with the more
stress liability you have and it just

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:34.620
wasn't for me so I took a break I was
like I just want to focus on me and my

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:39.450
business but I need some reputation so I
decided to go work get a big title under

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:42.120
my belt and so I was choosing between
call of duty

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.050
Nickelodeon and Disney interview those
companies and I chose call of duty and

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:48.020
worked there for a year

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.890
got that done and over with got out of
that the corporate corporate trenches of

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:57.740
Activision game development is not as
cool as you think it is everybody and

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:04.230
then started just doing here in their
got connected to a coating boot camp and

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:15.600
that's what led me here ok so questions
from the years I asked him about that

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:20.210
actually because he left it was
successful with with these applications

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:26.630
building and building them or himself
and he didn't realize it like he just

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:28.230
said he right now

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:35.180
lapses not quite as glamorous life as
you might think that it's gonna be and

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:44.340
was in a way where you wanted to be
spending his time in distress so back to

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:51.280
a point that market made here was
working in these camps and teaching

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:56.590
people in realizing that this is an
important point that's gonna play into

00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:00.479
some of the things that market is going
to be talking to you so tell the people

00:08:00.479 --> 00:08:04.590
about some of the things that she learns
you realize that you could that you were

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:09.910
good teaching and you could teach people
like little bit more detail about what

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:16.360
that experience has given you that's
helped you actually be the way you teach

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:22.940
directly translates to yourselves in the
end and here's the key what I learned is

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:27.370
you teach for understanding you know
that what's that phrase nobody cares how

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:30.130
much you know until they know how much
you care when you really care about your

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:32.580
students and want to teach them that's
what matters

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:36.570
there's actually lots of you to me
courses that I previewed or so it's like

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:37.830
I'm really smart

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:42.180
I'm going to teach what I know you don't
even caring about the student or what

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:45.300
what their end game isn't so I was
looking at these students and I was

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:48.910
actually had a chance to change their
lives and it was by focusing on the

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:51.040
things that matter most to them so
there's like for instance there's other

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.200
iOS courses that teach different
concepts Nick cover things like five

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:58.110
minutes at a time but I knew my students
needed something richer and grandeur

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:02.980
because I learned that in real life
teaching people want to get jobs they

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:06.060
want to make money they want to know how
well your teachers gonna benefit their

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:09.520
life so if you just teaching because you
know something it doesn't necessarily

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.410
translate to helping students that's the
most important thing I learned from the

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:18.120
coding boot camps which I directly
injected that knowledge and experience

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:24.860
into my courses absolutely so mean I
hope all of you

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:29.360
her dad and marked it kind of summarizes
a nice way that nobody cares about you

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:36.870
know until they know that you care about
the mindset that Mark has he's producing

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:40.070
his horses your next day just answered a
question that somebody else about

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:45.790
whether the classes are profitable
martin get back to that he'll tell you

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:50.270
that it is but something to keep in mind
is thinking about here

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:59.350
students he's showing them that he cares
so it's not all just about like what's

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:03.630
the way that I can squeeze the most
money so in terms of showing people that

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:10.370
you do when we talked earlier you did
mention things about like thought

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:14.250
leadership and community building and
connecting on an emotional personal

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:22.600
level so that all ties in with talk to
people a little bit about those ideas

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:29.160
well first I really do care every time I
get a personal message on you to me

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:33.370
from a student I answer it usually in
less than six hours as you see within

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:38.040
two hours or less I have an online chat
room and I interact every single day

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:42.980
with my students so for instance this
chatroom have a mobile app for it as

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:47.610
well and so if I'm at a grocery store
mcdonnell's my kids they're playing well

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:51.350
I could not have my phone and doing
nothing or interact with my students and

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:55.860
things like that so I make it a big
priority that they know me and I spent a

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:59.160
lot of time a lot of time person with
them they'll send a link to their

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:03.170
projects a look at their code it doesn't
take long at five minutes or less a look

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:08.569
at their code and and just goes a long
way are sometimes students just need

00:11:08.569 --> 00:11:11.449
direction you don't have to spend a lot
of time so they'll say how do I do this

00:11:11.449 --> 00:11:12.759
and I'll just give me a link

00:11:12.759 --> 00:11:16.420
a link to something I found on the
internet and have used before and it's

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:20.629
as simple as that so I interact my
students in a very personal personal

00:11:20.629 --> 00:11:25.730
matter and it's well if you guys like my
course I was nine from beginner to pay

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:32.839
professional it's almost 4,500 students
in over 300 reviews and just sometimes

00:11:32.839 --> 00:11:37.449
the students to feel connected and I'm
happy to help them so I spent a lot of

00:11:37.449 --> 00:11:41.550
time I think that I spend most of my
time doing interacting students
