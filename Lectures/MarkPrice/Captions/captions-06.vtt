00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
left here so give another person a
chance to ask a question here don't

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:14.559
think we can hear you ok I don't know
what the white yeah but the thing is I

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.279
tried the way that I wasn't that
successful so I was wondering how were

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.269
you able to make that work for you

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:28.310
yea good question read it's very
powerful it's also very dangerous I am

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.280
NOT a reddit fan lots of water very mean
people there so get ready you're gonna

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:40.250
be ready you better have sticks in but
so is there an anonymous community we

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.860
talk about subjects anonymously nobody
on reddit likes promotions ourselves

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.690
everyone ready hates it though what you
do with ready to be successful is is

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.829
used serve the purpose of Reddit which
is providing valuable people earn so if

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.140
you're teaching something make a youtube
video or a blog post this is how you do

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.300
it make it for free

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.750
ever postings that emotions things like
that and read it they just hate it

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.920
absolutely hate it but provide value to
the community and your post

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.250
voted and so every time I put out a new
YouTube video this is what happens I

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.380
post a youtube video and read it and
learn programming formats with forum I

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.460
say here's how you do this on iPhone and
sure enough to get a bloated and then

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.540
the next 15 minutes I see like 325
purchases that happens from my youtube

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.060
videos I sent them to you to YouTube
sent them to my enemy course I'll read

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.030
it put free stuff on there don't look at
yourself look at the people that are on

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.150
there how can you help them and then be
creative in how you can capture those

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.590
capture those leads unfortunately I I'm
a nice guy but I'm not nice enough to

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.070
just put your free stuff on red just be
a nice community builder but there's

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.759
great ways of doing it so that's how I
use reddit ok second question how do you

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:04.619
get so many reviewers because some of us
to meet you know maybe get some reviews

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:05.810
but it's been

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.080
that's a great question I have actually
learned some things that you going to

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.690
take notice you guys can all do this so
what I do is and I did especially

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.060
beginning not so much now coming at a
time but in the very beginning when I

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.690
had students anybody who made more than
3% progress I personally message to my

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.140
wrote them a letter and said hey John
thanks for taking my course this is

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.720
awesome 3% how can I help you what it
what can a teacher and by the way if

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.209
you're lovin this course please give me
an honest review it really helps and

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.890
probably twenty percent of the people
that I messaged me reviews that

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.470
instantly bumped it up

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.730
also in my chat room and other
interactions you guys probably have

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.239
people on Twitter like I love your
course or your cell thanks awesome or

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.720
you know three said that sourdough bread
is amazing you know you could say thanks

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.930
or you can say you know what

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.160
thank you and I would love for you to
put that thanks in a written review on

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.239
my course it really helps me every
single time so once showed any interest

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.280
in your course you ask them for you will
you give me a review

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.430
they took the time to message you
they're probably gonna give you a review

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.750
so that's really important to do as well

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.049
is every chance you have tell people to
give you reviews and more recently well

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.959
one thing I did also was a Senate
Education announcement with some value

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.859
and in the education announcement in big
bold to say hey everyone you guys are

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:31.569
great

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.569
even taking this course and that's
awesome but I need your help I need

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:38.639
reviews you guys are taken to score some
of you you said you loved it but you

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:43.560
having any reviews it really helps out
just ask people are asking for reviews

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.530
and every time I do that my reviews jump
up significantly and I i pace it out so

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.540
it's not like spam

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.100
but I asked them all the time there's
nothing wrong with that you guys

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.739
everyone just ask ask ask for reviews
and they will come don't ever ask for a

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.410
five star review I've never done that
once I just I kinda gauge their level if

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.889
someone's not like my course I don't ask
him to give you my bad reviews

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:13.540
anyone has any interest ask them to give
you a review and most likely they will

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.720
do it another question is this is for
you

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.610
now Facebook add those Google Ads have
each write those or have you not to

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.170
waste and is it the way still want you
to go and ask questions I get all the

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:34.250
time as well too so I've tried Facebook
ads they're my least converting adds a

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.500
facebook facebook crowds little bit
different and I can't speak for

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.760
everybody ok all I know is I have like
seven hundred Facebook friends friends

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.020
and family they don't give a crap about
my courses or anything I'm doing like I

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.540
can't tell them anything in my own
family my own uncles and stuff like like

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.690
my page no one does it so Facebook
you've got to be really careful in your

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.250
strategy gotta figure out what you're
trying to accomplish directs else for me

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:06.250
have not been great on Facebook I spent
$150 on Facebook and you know it barely

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.790
paid for itself so there's different
ways of strategizing on Facebook from

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.710
now on my facebook strategy is going to
be boosting my my facebook page my dev

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.120
slopes company page because that's where
the thought leadership comes and so am

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.590
giving away free stuff

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.950
knowledge information people want that
people don't on Facebook per my

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:31.060
experience that in my own family want to
buy stuff on Facebook so I don't ever do

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.270
ads on anymore

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:38.360
myself Google Ads have done that for my
subject they convert just fine but they

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.650
really brings me in about five to ten
dollars a day I could probably get more

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.340
if I focus more on it but I don't have
the time to focus on it cuz when you're

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.390
doing good glad you got to be monitoring
it make watching for click fraud

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.550
especially ask you to me structures who
don't have a whole lot of money in the

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.720
beginning like your budget can go
through in five minutes if you're not

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.820
careful you gotta closely monitor it and
I don't have time for that five cells

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:06.020
today is not worth it for me on on on
Google ads also have to compete with Rob

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.830
personal ads which is not an easy task
if I throw my ads up and I linked to my

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.630
course it takes off the enemies
advertisements and vice versa and I just

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:19.380
if you're going to do but as my advice
just focus on it and if it's making

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:24.150
sense keep doing it but it takes focus
and energy and effort Twitter ads of

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:31.440
actually my most successful this is part
of the tech industry people on Twitter

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.790
they just love tech as I got tons of
purchases even $50 purchase of people on

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:40.200
Twitter professionals and I never used
Twitter until I got into this but people

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.290
on Twitter are there's a lot of
professionals out there and they have

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:47.120
money to spend and so people actually
buy my course through Twitter with

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:57.620
direct advertisers to my course saying
it's my most successful yeah because

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:06.550
anybody used to it and so anyway they
they convert just fine I got lots of $49

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.720
purchases from it it's great again my
strategy is not gonna be doing direct

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.590
sales anymore I'm gonna folks my money
and advertisements on promoting my

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:18.830
Twitter accounts promoting my facebook
pages because I believe when I helping

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:20.070
people for free

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:22.540
they're going to be more inclined to
purchase then clicking a link that I

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:33.030
have to pay $1 for so we're successful
those it was great campaign and more

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:36.669
paid advertising that would direct links
to my course gonna put my money on

00:07:36.669 --> 00:07:39.490
building communities ok

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:44.240
your biggest success was actually doing
whatever we stopped and that was way

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:48.640
better than one if if you guys could all
just throw advertising all jumped out

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:49.350
the window

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:53.180
focus on YouTube making quality free
videos your name ourselves from that

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.190
than anything else

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:58.200
YouTube is my is my second focus on
trying to get video out a week it's

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:04.560
really hard but you to generate more
cells from any ad platform ok so what's

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:15.200
your secret for you to link to your
course just put on watch videos and the

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.630
best practices that only have the pop
ups at the end your video which links to

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:22.330
other videos which I should be doing and
subscribe buttons I just really quality

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:29.100
videos links my course there if you buy
it I got many many views on my videos in

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:32.580
just the last two months just cause
they're helpful so what's your next

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:33.830
class

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:38.500
the question everybody is asking if this
was down what what you've been doing

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:44.720
pretty good you have a plant with a new
one is coming up so many courses I've

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:48.410
got a roadmap of like 15 courses one
after the other after the other

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:55.060
intermediate iOS right now about
wrapping up a course called learn how to

00:08:55.060 --> 00:09:00.690
make games for iOS Android PC and Mac
without writing any code using build box

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:04.320
I'll be coming out a few days I'm
building a course on reactor web

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:09.920
development and I got a list

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:19.290
ok that's mostly at Tech tech classes I
mean some of our field so what's your

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:26.410
device that because otherwise I mean you
don't create that text and if you're not

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:31.270
into tech field sales don't don't go the
same one you to me I know you guys know

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:34.400
how this is amazing

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:40.970
was a lot of people who go in you're
going to that text field so they always

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:41.660
go

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:48.100
matters are just like I'm just asking
you want to try something outside of Tao

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:52.880
ko you just going to just keep your good
at it was a focus what they're good at

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:59.020
my end W sourdough Theresa she's like
the inspiration for it they should all

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:04.300
follow I I'm not trying to entice a
sourdough is not interesting but it's no

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:09.140
less interesting than you know how to
train your dog or anything else she's

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:12.000
she's Lady need to talk to me she knows
what she's doing

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.520
you know I should text popular but I
believe in you know if I wasn't teaching

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:21.320
programming I'll be working just as hard
on whatever other subjects I'm doing on

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:24.810
here is a fantastic platform and I that
she had people other instructors

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:29.500
approach need to be contractors who are
making like 15 grand a month twenty
