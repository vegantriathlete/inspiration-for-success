00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.370
ok in so we had a question about how do
you build community and marks actually

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.110
getting it some of that is answer right
now if you're listening when he was just

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.679
saying about the league heavily in by
the way did you hear him say that he's

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:20.890
actually willing to look at their code
ok he's not just teaching people over

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.269
here to watch me on the screen here I'm
telling you how did you hear what he

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:29.800
actually want to take the time to have a
look at their code any easy to some

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.940
other things that I do want to pull out
is well the idea

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:43.020
mark talk to people like this that they
need to know about the technical details

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.489
but about late because this definitely
ties into how you build and it's

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.820
important for people to know this so
online chat platform uses marked down so

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.010
you can do all kinds of things from
pacing code to building and all that

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.890
kind of stuff it's kind of like slack
but more for developers you gotta have a

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.680
have account to get in if I wasn't a
developer i'd probably using slack right

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.040
now but basically I tell my students
come to the chance on post something in

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.100
the discussions on you to me help you
out and what actually happened is that

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.070
people have joined the chat rooms and
now they help each other and so there's

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.009
a community of people helping each other
and making friends and connections on

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.880
LinkedIn and this community has started
to form and I'm not even there have to

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.869
time but other people are and like so
far it seems like today I launched my

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.509
first online store to sell swag like my
my dad slows my company logo and stuff

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.310
within five minutes a launching already
got three purchases from students about

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.509
my t-shirts hats and the like this
awesome to tweeting about it and all

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.530
because I have this live interactive
community and people interact with me

00:01:50.530 --> 00:02:01.740
real-time ok so we are getting questions
here about how you get started things I

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.450
think that's gonna tie-in well enough
with this whole topic of our overall

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.610
topic today is about the idea of

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:17.690
a major part of Mark success is by
looking to be best in class with his

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:24.420
unique courses that he teaches in one of
the way city is by provide connecting on

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:32.100
an emotional level in having this
personal interaction with students as a

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.020
people were asked about how he
kick-started things without a list in so

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.820
it all ties in with this idea of
building communities I think it's the

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:50.470
go-ahead an answer that did you come in
without a list and in iOS is competitive

00:02:50.470 --> 00:03:05.090
popular but it's also the 10th here you
know nothing not one email accounts no

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.270
website all I have is my skill and my
faith that something great would turn

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:15.890
out so anyway i released as coursework
my brains out to get it out and

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:21.420
literally just four weeks counting the
street when I say pounding the streets

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:28.110
communicating to the world on my course
existed so I'm very specific things that

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.130
I do which which all of you can actually
do viewed the various disciplines as

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:46.310
or cure however you spell it just pull
put the link here what is it that I get

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.690
answered any type of question people
plus everything so every single day I

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.260
was posing there and I was like where
should I start an iOS development and I

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.030
would say this is what you should do and
I give an explanation and the body the

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.670
bottom everything one of my posts I
would have links to my course and people

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:08.120
start buying its ok was very powerful
and to this day my post some core that I

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.180
said I made like two months ago when I
first started are still generating cells

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.209
from those links because they stay there
forever so you can have any this plan

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.549
from how to train your dog to
hypnotherapy to whatever there's

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.510
questions about everything so I started
spending lots of time there

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.530
r LinkedIn I have a big LinkedIn network
and I've been working on it for the last

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.900
year and a half I spent an hour on
LinkedIn a day for the last year and a

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:39.180
half and so I started making posts there
about my course in about you know how

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.250
you can be successful in bringing money
and i was just explaining the world

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:49.370
would I was doing I was posting about my
courses there read it I spent a lot of

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:55.930
time on read it in fact one post I made
on read it generated $2,500 in two hours

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:02.290
from one post on read it with that being
said the reddit community now hates me

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:06.780
in fact in their learn programming
threat they have a sticky post at the

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:12.690
top that talks to me courses and
instructors and that is because of me

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:18.020
unfortunately because my post generate
so much hype so what I do now on and

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.770
read it is I'll pay the rules and I post
a youtube videos which then went to my

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:29.830
course what was the question again where
we going with us we're just looking at

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:39.000
some of the specific strategy is to just
so you to today it has generated almost

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.190
three thousand dollars in sales for me
this is like in the last course is only

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:47.990
been out for two months just by posting
free videos and I link back to the link

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:54.740
back to my course and just keep coming
from those videos I never thought it

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.820
would be so easy and so this is crazy

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:02.340
in two months I've gotten over 1,000
YouTube subscribers and I had zero and

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:07.910
that's from four videos video so YouTube
has been very powerful so this is what I

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:12.910
did not have it having nothing knowing
nothing my Twitter account had like 20

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.860
followers now I've got over 200

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:24.480
growing house post post to the world

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:33.710
yeah that market me because I know
you're all excited about oh my god it's

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:38.300
going to be successful but then I hope
you heard mark say that when he started

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:45.170
this he didn't just say I didn't have an
email list he said I didn't have an

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:54.870
email as I didn't have a website I
didn't have that he didn't have any

00:06:54.870 --> 00:07:01.670
thing when he started doing this all
those pieces in place in its all coming

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:07.250
together for him and other state partner
with it is coming together is the way

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:11.710
mark is connecting with people

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:18.480
ok he got on Quora I guess is a good
example read it is maybe not such a

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:22.650
great example cuz Mar kind of broke the
rules there and got himself in a little

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:27.740
bit of a bad situation although I don't
intentionally but you know he's in

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:32.330
little bit more careful with what he's
getting out there and he's interacting

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:39.600
with people to build that relationship
to pry them some value and you know

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:48.580
there are 76 people watching right now
just coming right now in part of the

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:54.330
reason that the lab was so well known is
that mark is also in the studio for

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.960
those of you are not familiar with you
to me that's ok this isn't just you two

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:08.420
meet you in the studio he's giving
people some help and some suggestions as

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:16.060
to what generated when mark shared with
people houses wanted to know how did you

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:21.040
do it and so Mark said you know what
lets out how about this I'll do this on

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:25.110
a black so that people will have this
information and it'll be accessible to

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:29.610
them and they'll be able to run to know
what I did the same questions over and

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:30.290
over again

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:32.849
you guys could just go to my website
later

00:08:32.849 --> 00:08:40.569
so so I do want us to shift gears to the
main topic here and as Marx talk about

00:08:40.569 --> 00:08:43.709
some of the stuff out scroll through the
questions to make sure keeping track of

00:08:43.709 --> 00:08:51.269
the things that people want to cover but
one of the key strategies that mark used

00:08:51.269 --> 00:08:57.120
to make sure that his class was really
going to be able to take off was this

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:05.180
idea of doing it better than anybody
else in market already mentioned about

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:10.019
this when he said he looked at some of
the unique courses he could see that

00:09:10.019 --> 00:09:16.319
maybe the instructor is smart and a new
alot but they didn't seem to exude any

00:09:16.319 --> 00:09:21.209
type of caring for their students so go
ahead marc talk to people about how you

00:09:21.209 --> 00:09:29.160
use that strategy like being the best in
class when I first got into you to me I

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:35.079
looked at the competition which was
rough personal and I was like wow

00:09:35.079 --> 00:09:39.730
100,000 students if I'm gonna do
anything at all about to make sure I put

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:44.689
some thought into it so what I decided
was I wanted to course I would actually

00:09:44.689 --> 00:09:50.019
be effective in helping people get a job
as iPhone programmer and I think this is

00:09:50.019 --> 00:09:52.829
applicable across all disciplines you
know what whatever you want to

00:09:52.829 --> 00:09:56.959
accomplish and by the way I've actually
had two Sudans tell me they've gotten

00:09:56.959 --> 00:10:05.000
jobs because my course which is amazing
and so everything I didn't I every every

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.740
thought that came from my brain was how
do I help the student achieve this goal

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:11.449
which I know they want to achieve which
is becoming an iPhone developer or

00:10:11.449 --> 00:10:15.699
working from home or living a better
life and so I don't wait

00:10:15.699 --> 00:10:19.459
also ask a question earlier on there in
how do you as a programmer how do you

00:10:19.459 --> 00:10:23.410
differentiate like talking too much
about something versus making it more

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:28.339
brief for making the pie so everything I
did was directed for the sole purpose of

00:10:28.339 --> 00:10:31.810
say hey what is gonna be most effective
in you getting a job and you making

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:35.339
money and so I throw all the other junk
that's why my course mile s course we

00:10:35.339 --> 00:10:39.120
don't have things that other courses
have like maps or flapping bird like

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:44.220
like you know you know there's courses
they built twenty out well that's that's

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:46.290
nice but it's not going to help you get
a job

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:49.350
appears that things are going to help
you get a job as everything I taught was

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:52.560
for the student and I throughout the
study all the marketing gimmicks I

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.380
didn't want anything like that I just
wanted that's why I don't have

00:10:55.380 --> 00:11:00.269
intercourse we do bill 20 out high
quality ABS doesn't say that my title

00:11:00.269 --> 00:11:03.009
because that's not what the courses
about the courses about how can you come

00:11:03.009 --> 00:11:07.410
from a beginner to pay profession so my
point is everything I did was geared

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:12.050
towards the student and every every step
of the way and I believe thats what sets

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:18.009
me apart and I mean I think my review
right now is so do the math is between

00:11:18.009 --> 00:11:21.449
nine and 10 percent and I think
