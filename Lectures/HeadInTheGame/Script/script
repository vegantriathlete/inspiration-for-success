It's okay if you expressed doubts or fears when you completed the previous exercise. I would be surprised if you didn't. If you really had 100% confidence and only positive thoughts you probably wouldn't be taking this course!

It's important for you to be able to be honest with yourself. Pretending that you don't think, feel or believe something is just setting yourself up for failure. You must be able to accept reality for what it is.

The key is to be able to see not only what really is right now, but to also be able to see what can be in the future.

There is nothing magic about achieving success.

It's about recognizing where your strengths (that you either currently possess or can build) intersect with where there is a need.
It's about taking the necessary action consistently over a long enough period of time.
Get your head in the game!

You must believe that you are capable of doing the two preceding things.

You must accept that failure and mistakes are likely going to be part of your journey.
You must be able to hear and act upon constructive criticism.
You must have a sincere desire to be of service.
You must develop a mind set of patience and persistence.
You must recognize that as much as anything else, it's your thoughts that will determine your outcome.
