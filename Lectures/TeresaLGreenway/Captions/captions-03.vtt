00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.310
calls all your classes actually work
then it can actually follow your

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.550
instructions and when they take your
class they can actually produce not only

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.469
do they seem to work really well but the
students get so excited that you're out

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.750
there and tell everyone else and so they
are also without meat ending part of my

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:27.920
marketing they will you know i i get a
lot of weird and very good and so what

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.690
plans do you have for future classes on
you to me I think you've got three clear

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:44.579
glass classic black classic breads and I
and I just 101 for beginners because

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.879
some of the other courses a little too
much for someone just starting out so

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:57.360
the 101 class has just two loaves of
bread and I take them by step when

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.590
they're done if they're not they didn't
involve that much time but they're

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.280
usually and they want to continue on and
take the other classes great so do you

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.810
have plans to do more classes beyond the
three that you said you got this

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:22.880
four-volume book it was 400 something
pages here got a whole lot of I'm hoping

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:37.040
to get it ready and the other courses
that there's a little bit but that's

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:44.890
what I'm doing the old-timey sourdough
like the 49ers Jackson the waffles and

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:51.570
the old-fashioned you know in the
village and that sort of thing so I'm

00:01:51.570 --> 00:02:03.719
fashions reads well you know I think
it's a really interesting story I'm so

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.570
happy for you to share with us

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.090
I'd like to touch on just a little bit

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.489
covered right now that also makes your
story interesting because not only are

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:20.550
you having success and you to me with
this class you know people wouldn't

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:27.900
typically think of the first thing to go
to make money but you had to come from a

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:42.019
background that China like handy
optimally for success so how did you how

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:47.739
did you do that you mentioned you
created a website and you know that you

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:57.230
make the sourdough bread so like how
were you able to see who you know to

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.280
learn all those things to do be able to
you you know succeed in really like

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:10.010
you're beginning to throw by the you
know less than optimal

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:35.650
thirty year and five years ago I pretty
much I went into my mother was the end

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.959
of April and at the same time I just
published my first and I was working on

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:48.220
my memoir which took me five years to
write it was just published in September

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.510
it's called out of reach

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:59.000
joy and all evil link if anybody wants
you to check it out I come from a

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.680
challenging background and I didn't have
a degree and no real work is everyone in

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:14.489
the USA job didn't feel that I could
compete brother-in-law offered to pain

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.630
for me to go to college

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:22.440
disabled son at home I didn't feel
waiting four years

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:29.340
hitting the books was going back and
forth to take care of my mother so I

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.970
decided to do what I've always enjoyed
doing and that is to be an entrepreneur

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:46.340
I sold cupcakes and I was 10 years old
and I've always so basically I that's

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:54.100
why we started this out with me and I'll
leave her as well she was so

00:04:54.100 --> 00:05:04.710
inspirational in my condition at the
time and a little by little I regained

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:14.350
my self-esteem myself and I went for it
I gave it all that I i think what's the

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:21.290
best for me is that I just love it it's
not like I'm doing I get up I put in

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:34.570
when I'm doing them videos and doing
it's just so you'll be able to work and

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:43.190
earn money it's something I think
absolutely absolutely and just to let

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.169
you know I will make sure that I got
links to all the various resources

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:53.470
that's resist mentioned and the replay
on my website so you'll be able to get

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.580
it all the things she said I'll make
sure she gives me the information for

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.930
her book on Amazon she's got her memoirs
she's got the book or ebook on making

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:08.350
sourdough she's a website YouTube
channel at all that stuff website is

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:15.600
Mark yahoo.com you can go there and
you'll be able to get it off later on

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.600
now

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:21.120
other things that theresa has been
mentioned here so she did she did

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.770
actually speak about the fact that she's
got a son at home was disabled that she

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:32.040
needs to take care of right now and then
jeez I believe one other child

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.000
that you have two other children who are
in high school right now

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:48.410
ok and injuries actually has a total
children who are still alive so so she

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:57.530
had quite the backgrounds interesting
experiences coming in to YouTube and

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:04.530
she's really been able to use it you
know a platform to help her to to

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:13.030
support herself and to support her
family and to just try and regain her

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:19.410
self-esteem so I'm so glad that we had
the chance to hear about Teresa story

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:24.120
there so there's a look at the questions
here we can open it up for questions and

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:33.080
answers right now there was nobody would
ask how many tutorials you based on your

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.100
sales the first month in what your
average each month let me ask you

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:52.180

organic sales hot like how are your

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:08.570
sales are you making for a while they're
like 97% and then my sales were down a

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:12.510
bit and then you to pick up and I think
right now

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:21.640
micelles so I i dont have enough
experience over years to know how that

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:31.560

that your YouTube channel is

00:08:39.089 --> 00:08:44.439
