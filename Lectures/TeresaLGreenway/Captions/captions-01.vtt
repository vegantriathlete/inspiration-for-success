00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.090
ok we are live first installment of you
to meet weekly inspiration for success

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:16.500
i'm mark isaacson and I'm your host you
can find me I knew it in the HTTPS

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.070
of this is that when the guys here

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:32.009
HTTPS colon boards as first-class
www.youtube.com / you / mark isaacson

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.840
I'm still relatively new to you to me
and I have certainly made my share of

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.260
mistakes and I currently have three
published courses so if you're

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.629
interested in purchasing those courses
at a discount for you you can get my

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.719
courses at the discount so you can just
say to apply the code and I'll get you

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:02.230
my three courses discounts before we get
started want to go over a few

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:08.000
administrative tasks so if you've
subscribed to the lab then you'll get an

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.810
email from lab with a link to the replay
and I'm also going to make all the

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:22.500
replays available on my website which is
Marquis isaacson dot com so if you want

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.570
to ask questions we are gonna have a
question and answer session at the end

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.060
of the interview you can post your
questions at any time but to make it

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.799
easier for us if you received your
question with a forward slash it makes

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:45.270
it easier to fill those questions later
on so how do I ask a question so once

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.009
you put it forward slash their in Texas
with this question and then we can be

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.270
heard at the end and we'll see all the
questions there so you can feel free to

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.000
ask questions as we going through the
interview but we will wait till the end

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.070
to answer all of those questions and
once we open the Q&amp;A session then I will

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.850
open up a seat for people to sit in

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.850
and you can grab see you can ask
questions directly but I will be making

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.240
sure that we keep the lab to one hour or
less so that we can get this many

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:20.090
questions can and if you do decide to
take a seat that there may be other

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.480
people would like to be able to take a
seat and conducting the black would be

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.610
great if you could click that little
rather tell a little bird button that

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.260
lets people know about it that rely upon
the lab and we can attract other people

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.800
as far as links that we post into the
lab today even though the link text

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.930
itself looks like it's normally when you
actually click the link is appended this

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.030
question mark

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.510
lakes and so if you find that a link is
not working when you use it just goes

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.709
your address bar of your browser in
strip out that question mark

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:04.040
equals so with all of administrative
stuff right now I'm really excited to

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.700
have the chance to introduce my very
first guess he's got a great story to

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.810
share with you and Teresa Greenway is an
instructor of sourdough courses

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.910
available on youtube.com theresa has
been successful with courses that are

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.459
not usually thought to be highly
successful like for instance that tech

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.310
business and entrepreneur courses she
has an online business called Northwest

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:38.370
sourdough or volume book called is
covering sourdough she also recently

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.840
published her memoir titled reach for
joy in which she chronicles her escape

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:50.100
from an abusive marriage welcome to the
cast Teresa so tell us a little bit

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.480
about yourself

00:03:52.480 --> 00:04:02.260
my name is my passion is to teach people
how to make sourdough I've been making

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:09.170
sourdough about eleven years now and i
turn my passion into

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:22.620
video I go I thirty-year abusive
marriage I found myself without the

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.200
means to support myself and I didn't
have a college degree I had no real work

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:36.250
part time making we're gonna be a part
time and I have two children

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:42.720
supports bill so I began to look for
ways where I could make it home and this

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:49.729
eventually led me to becoming an
instructor in April of this year

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:59.590
ok great so so you made your way to you
and your teaching the sourdough taking

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:05.540
courses so is that what you decided to
do right away on you to me his idea that

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:12.870
you're gonna be teaching teaching these
glasses are now actually I was I was

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:22.000
enrolled in a class online or by Cheryl
bar and it was women and men as well but

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.479
it's aimed at women learn to make money
so she encouraged me to you you what I

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:35.510
know and what I know so I started
looking up online how I might make money

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:44.510
other than my book which I have on
Amazon and I found some meat courses on

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.930
how to optimize YouTube channel

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:56.740
how do you make a video or how do you
work with audio there was so many

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:02.050
interesting part is how do you have a
business and optimize it on the internet

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:08.660
and my children is disabled I need to
know where you get home and having an

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:17.479
online businesses began taking these
parts of this was last winter and early

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:20.370
in the year began taking courses

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:33.260
I can do a course why of course and so
began taking courses on optimizing video

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:38.880
how to do a good job

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:59.220
ok so we're taking classes and
optimizing video audio and so in you

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:07.500
well so why why why why are you taking
those classes you said you didn't

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:12.500
actually come to YouTube teaching so
what was the reason that you were just

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:22.910
why are you taking these were from Alan
hill and I think most of us instructors

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:29.889
have taken courses are at least one of
them and he inspired me because I had to

00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:37.160
YouTube channel on the maybe 25 30
videos where I had taking courses and I

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:46.490
videotape and I did a few of my own and
I was making maybe thirty cents it was

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:51.169
you know anything I thought would
support me and he'll inspired me that

00:07:51.169 --> 00:07:58.960
perhaps that was a way I make money I
started in optimizing my youtube right

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:10.110
away I saw an increase and within a
short time I was made maybe $100 and it

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:16.590
was when I realized you know this might
take awhile I need to do something out

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:23.620
and that's when I started thinking maybe
I should make my own and and then I

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:31.900
realized later YouTube is really make a
lot of money but I think for me

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:43.400
or showing my work my students involved
in and or or redirecting them to my

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:50.770
books it's it's a great vehicle ok so
you mentioned this bloke in you

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:55.080
mentioned you been doings sourdough with
the sourdough business for quite a

00:08:55.080 --> 00:09:00.279
number of years now so tell me a little
bit more about the sourdough business

00:09:00.279 --> 00:09:06.610
did you hear that you got this
four-volume book as well as well about

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:16.520
eleven years ago my oldest daughter teen
or maybe she decided she wanted to try

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:21.270
to make rules and she tried for a month
there was almost nothing available

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:33.370
online and was it was it was a difficult
challenge though she couldn't do it

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:44.440
after a month she gave up and she said
nobody not even you I thought oh yeah I

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:55.910
took up the challenge and it took me
about what I could online and I i worked

00:09:55.910 --> 00:10:00.240
out and worked at it and I had no idea
what I was doing I bought Nancy

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:17.440
Silverton book business so that was my
first break through and I continued

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:23.160
working at it and I finally pulled a
real sourdough loaf of my oven that was

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:37.220
all really excited I had to go and I was
so happy about that and so excited that

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:38.380
I started

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:47.740
web page and I Yahoo which is no longer
and I tried to show other people had a

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:52.720
baked sourdough because anything out
there I wanted to share what I learn so

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.980
that was the beginning of my business

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:55.580
ok
