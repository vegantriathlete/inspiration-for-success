Saudi you had that debt when he and you
mentioned a business like what were you

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:15.030
doing with that is what I post stuff did
you sell a well I started by telling I

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.789
made my own sourdough starter which is
really exciting when you make your own

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.199
sourdough starter and it's bubbling away
and it works it actually makes bread so

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:27.250
I tried it and I told sourdough starters
and then people from around the world

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.580
began sending me their starters so I
have I still have a collection of about

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.550
11 or 12 starters from around the world
and I began writing them and selling

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:43.210
also started selling baking equipment
but the thing that I enjoyed the most

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:49.460
was teaching people would ask me the
same questions over and over I finally

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.190
decided you know I need to write those
questions down and I need to answer that

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:00.300
and I need to put that well that ended
up turning into after five years it was

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:07.240
so big that it was for mullions 400
pages so instead of when people ask me

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:16.979
the same questions I would say well read
it and retail side of the business

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:24.530
became too difficult for me when my
personal relationship deteriorated and

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.259
so I stopped doing the retail but I
tried to continue supporting

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:35.909
on my website and on my blog that went
away for a while as well it's packed

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:46.369
full course no ok so how long ago did
you start your YouTube channel I would

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.579
have to to look to see for sure I'm
guessing it would be in around 10 years

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:56.219
ago okay okay so you've had your YouTube
channel on for a while and you mentioned

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.270
you had your website did you set up
eleven years ago or so when you are

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.640
starting to do this and you got your
book that's out there that you have on

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.390
Amazon and so you came to get me started
taking these classes taught how to

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:21.750
optimize your YouTube shadow and then
you eventually got this idea that I

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.030
could make a course on youtube so you
did it you did you became an instructor

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.030
and you to be greeted the course so what
are some of the things that you

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.450
encountered it will you in creating this
course you know when you first released

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:47.010
this may be presented a challenge to you
well I'm living in a shop right now and

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:53.879
I didn't think that I could even do it
because the background I don't have a

00:02:53.879 --> 00:03:02.970
real kitchen floor as pain free and I
felt intimidated by my surroundings make

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.500
a video of these visions beautiful
kitchens like you see on TV where people

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:16.550
are doing there and I didn't have that I
still go and see what I can do that and

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.099
then I thought well I mean if people
don't like it they want

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:28.980
well and I will try to focus mostly on
my hands and so I went ahead and did

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:36.970
some videos and I didn't have a really
great camera which was ok but it wasn't

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:43.370
optimal and I didn't understand about
audio setup I think most of us

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:52.280
inspectors have and I had a use the
camera my and it was terrible like most

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.310
of them are and so it wasn't learning
her I had to learn how to use software

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:08.840
for cleaning up my audio and lots of
things you know how to be president

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.400
so so I think there were plenty of
challenges but it was a lot of fun

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:24.570
really ok good and so obviously you over
Team those challenges because you are

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:32.320
actually courses so how about telling
people some of the things that you've

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.990
done that have worked well what has led
to your success here with sales of your

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.800
courses

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:55.880
well absolutely no way I ever imagined
this much money I went from no idea that

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:03.720
I would make that much of my biggest
over 5,000 and I average about this

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:36.050
point and i learn proper description and
my my youtube channel about and i would

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:48.750
tell people join my group perfect
sourdough and my Facebook group exploded

00:05:48.750 --> 00:06:00.669
it's got everything people in and
directs them to other channels and other

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:13.310
channels you and that's what I did I i
put links and coupon giveaway in my

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:14.190
Facebook group

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:20.470
contest I tried to make my group really
exciting and it's growing at the rate

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:33.040
I would guess maybe a hundred people
every two people every day I tried to

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:38.560
optimize my website which had fallen by
the way I'm still working on a work in

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:45.500
progress I redid my blog and I updated
it and I've been posting quite a bit

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:56.570
more I will make my new post those on my
blog and then repost groups and so

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:12.840
everything that I did try I tried to
work together I also made some help make

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:22.060
your starter and and I to all my other
stuff and so it's kind of like a picture

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:28.570
where everybody goes everywhere to get
everything and I'm trying to make fun

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:35.780
very good but i mean obviously you're
very busy you you're working hard

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:42.320
there's so many avenues that you're
pursuing show you how to create your to

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:50.060
become a magnet like you say you're
putting a lot of effort into it so how

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:54.600
how do you continue to keep putting that
much energy and effort into these

00:07:54.600 --> 00:08:02.750
classes what's right because it's just
like little bits and pieces of

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:07.580
everything that I can think of anything
new that I learned about I I try to add

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:15.479
that on I continued to take courses I'm
YouTube but what drives me is it's my

00:08:15.479 --> 00:08:24.950
goal in my dreams you get into you and i
wanna beautiful kitchen new courses so

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:32.400
well besides basic back needing to
support myself and my children my dream

mostest student who's never for all
