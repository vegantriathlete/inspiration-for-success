In order to be able to recognize where your skills intersect with a need, you must start by knowing what your skills are. It's time for you to sit down and list everything you know how to do currently. It doesn't matter whether you are good at it right now or not. Make sure that in addition to listing "hard" skills like repairing engines or drawing figures you also list "soft" skills like reading peoples' body language, resolving conflicts and sensing when something "big" is about to happen. To make the process easy, don't censor or edit as you go. You can get the ball rolling by listing things like brushing your teeth and tying your shoes! Focus on simply creating the list.

When you have finished compiling the list I encourage you to read through the discussion posts attached to this lecture and then add any of your skills that haven't already been listed.
