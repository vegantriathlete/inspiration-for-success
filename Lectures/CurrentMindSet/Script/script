You've enrolled in this course, presumably watched the first lecture and taken the first quiz. So, it may seem obvious that you are serious about achieving success in your life. Well, let's not make any assumptions.

It's easy for you to just proceed through one lecture after another even if you aren't prepared to do the things you need to do to succeed. The first thing to check is whether you are in the right state of mind.

Before proceeding any further in this course, sit down and take the time to answer the following prompts. But, don't stop there. Do a complete mind dump. Keep on writing, recording, journaling, painting or whatever you are doing to accurately and completely capture what thoughts and beliefs you currently hold until you can't think of a single thing more. Does this request seem too much? Over the top? If so, then you've just gotten your first piece of feedback that you are not really serious.

Are you ready?

Here are some prompts to get you started.

What do you think your odds of success are?
How do your odds compare with others' odds?
What do you think is the greatest challenge you will have to overcome to achieve success?
How afraid are you of failing?
What's the worst thing that could happen?
How would you react if the worst happened?
How willing are you to reveal your desire to succeed to others? (Give a detailed answer that describes the types of things you would say)
How willing are you to reveal your plan to succeed to others? (Give a detailed answer that describes the types of things you would say)
Why are you taking this course?
What do you expect to get out of this course?
How honest have you been with your answers?
When you have finished this exercise, I encourage you to share as much of your answers as you are willing as a discussion post attached to this lecture. I also encourage you to read through the answers others have given and comment on their responses (in a supportive way, of course).
