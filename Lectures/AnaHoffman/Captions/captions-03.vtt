00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.230
good so some of the basic living now
does apply more specifically as you say

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.010
like how to start getting your blog off
the ground and it's something that I

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.670
think is definitely worthwhile for
people to keep in mind

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.369
dead again putting this into the context
assuming that you're talking about

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.070
people who are looking to sell their
unique classes are looking to sell some

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:39.570
other type of product or service is
deaths you can still utilize a blog

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.739
effectively to start building your
presence in start getting people to know

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.350
about you before you actually try to
sell your product or service so even

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.949
though some of the things that I just
talked about here don't necessarily the

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:00.750
exact analogy like she likes of the
things I discussed in the beginning like

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.970
oh the same with you do that we need to
do this it still is part of the strategy

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.360
that you're gonna need to use in
building your business or brawl and one

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:17.310
of the things that are dimensioned more
than one time you have to be prepared to

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.330
invest that time to do this that it's
not gonna happen quickly it's not going

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.420
to happen overnight and I know that I
myself had fallen to that same type of a

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.090
trap that I get this great idea and so I
have built something and then right away

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.950
I'm so anxious I want people to pay any
money I want to get out there and I want

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.810
to start selling this right now and
that's something that can really be self

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.590
defeating shit like get in people's face
in trying to get them to buy something

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:55.610
from you and so we need to step back in
a little bit more thought into how we're

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.570
going to build the audience over time
how we're going to build those

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.700
relationships and go back to something
that honest said earlier about when she

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.670
launched her first log she just kind of
created content and then SAT and waited

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.760
for people to come to it and

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.959
when they didn't come then she stood
back and thought about well maybe I

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.450
should have researched this a little bit
more I started blogging and in the same

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.920
way if we're looking to sell some
product or service we may want to take a

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:27.989
step back

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.840
not necessarily about researching that
product or service but putting together

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.760
a strategy for how am I gonna start to
build the relationships home gonna start

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.239
to build some traffic before I got your
service

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:49.909
ready to unleash on the public and say
hey by this from me so I want to come

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:56.920
back to some of the points that was
making i'm gonna go back to hanging

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:05.200
around the blogs in building the
relationships on the blog and discussed

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.889
it a little bit but just to give you the
chance to be stated in like totally it

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:15.549
is over the head with it so what types
of things were you doing those logs that

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:26.859
you were hanging around to build the
relationships and the influence and

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:34.470
marketing is all the buttons and I think
a lot of us who actually became more or

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:43.040
less successful online focus focus was
less and marketing and word of mouth

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:51.810
marketing and building relationships
that relationships actually gave our

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:59.049
business that kind of pushed it needed
and what did you have to focus on the

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:05.500
influence on the people who you want to
build relationships but not on you from

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:14.099
ODU self because that never works so
let's say your objective is to build a

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:21.180
relationship with my mark I'm sorry mark
I write so

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:31.990
cold rinse and I think well how about
this I'm going what would benefit mark

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.699
in his business

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:41.360
post on social media would benefit his
business what other people are doing

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:48.210
that to yourself what can I do just when
I share on social media a couple of

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:57.270
things would consider is Sharon quotes
from and not just quotes but sharing

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:06.590
image from Mark's close so there are a
couple of good that make you that I'm

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:22.430
sure most of us and and Pablo allows you
very quickly quote from anywhere you

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:31.949
like getting ready have images in Pablo
all you do is just get a quote who said

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:40.060
it and then you can share it through
butter right there with the link to the

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:51.560
blog posts and what that does is warm
and he looks he does this nice image has

00:05:51.560 --> 00:06:00.340
his quote the time to not just read the
pros but also called him and an image

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:05.639
that's because they are different
because it shows the effort and again

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:10.530
you don't do anything you're just out
there

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:13.569
benefiting mark in as much as many ways

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:28.949
that's my husband hopefully he's not
going to anyway so that's one thing that

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:39.899
we can do another thing is that and yeah
everybody else does write what you need

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:47.149
to make an impression and the one thing
that he can do is not just comment on

00:06:47.149 --> 00:06:54.819
the blog posts and discussion about it
so if you have something to warn you

00:06:54.819 --> 00:07:01.559
have an opinion that slightly different
from what's in the post and again you're

00:07:01.559 --> 00:07:07.899
not creating an argument here just
trying to create and what that does is

00:07:07.899 --> 00:07:14.899
either comment on the blog post start
jumping in and that creates discussion

00:07:14.899 --> 00:07:16.409
and discussion

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:25.959
rates interest in more traffic because
more people are nuts and peaks other

00:07:25.959 --> 00:07:32.729
people's curiosity basically actually
take the discussion away from the blog

00:07:32.729 --> 00:07:43.209
and social media and what that does is
that it's exposed to more people and

00:07:43.209 --> 00:07:50.680
more people might be jumping in on the
discussion and again you will create a

00:07:50.680 --> 00:08:01.399
buzz around other people and that makes
you stand out and that almost always so

00:08:01.399 --> 00:08:16.610
that once the marketing tips I've got
you know over the years and there are

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:24.569
plenty of different folks have done to
stand out in my eyes because my blog is

00:08:24.569 --> 00:08:25.460
not

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:33.890
Walker it gets a lot of attention that
sometimes might go through much it's

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:41.120
really hard to notice we bought my blog
and I'm sure but I don't know when to

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:48.430
come up with things that actually turned
out it really will be so much attention

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:57.110
to you walk in if I can mention that I
actually did write a blog post but

00:08:57.110 --> 00:09:04.730
marking where everything down talking
about other people and i watch them and

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:07.040
I created like 20 wanna

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:19.120
examples of a parking lot just but this
is what others did what work so they're

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:25.709
plenty of tips like that but make sure
it's all about them about you and what

00:09:25.709 --> 00:09:27.510
that does

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:34.420
and people will start coming back to you
and your stuff simply because you've

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:44.180
done that first asked you got a really
great example you can provide people so

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:48.089
I describes that here are the things
that you need to do to make it about

00:09:48.089 --> 00:09:53.930
that influence your going to somebody
has got good influence but you're not

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:59.420
trying to promote yourself you're trying
to stroke the ego of that influencer to

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:04.260
stand out and get them to notice you
describe a lot of things that you can do

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:08.680
to make that happen in the things that
take effort and it takes time like I

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:13.209
don't think just because you took the
time to share one quote picture that

00:10:13.209 --> 00:10:16.730
suddenly this influencers gonna fall in
love with you it is going to be driving

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:22.029
traffic to your site and your product or
service over a period of time seeing

00:10:22.029 --> 00:10:26.350
that you're changing in this type of
effort to get their attention and that

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:32.399
may seem like wow alright I want to
build a relationship I know it needs to

00:10:32.399 --> 00:10:38.320
be about the other person and I need to
know that at some lines

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:42.700
it is gonna come back to me and i i just
don't know that it's really gonna happen

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:52.020
so share with the audience on a great
example of how you were actually the one

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:57.210
that was kinda in the role of the
influence and somebody else your

00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:57.730
attention
