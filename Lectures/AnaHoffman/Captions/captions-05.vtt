00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.720
I have opened see people have gotten a
just over 10 minutes here I'm gonna

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.880
follow up with about the same she just
said but you want to have the

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.840
opportunity this seat is open if you
want to jump into it as we're gonna be

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.190
wrapping up here soon so is ours when it
was just telling us in expertise so a

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:24.310
couple points that you know I take away
from that so I was making her income

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.439
through affiliate links in the only way
that you're gonna make money

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.590
an affiliate links is it you drive
enough traffic to your links so

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:41.950
obviously if she is making money off her
legs she must actually be good at

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:48.469
driving traffic to her site in what
she's teaching you on her site is how to

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:54.190
drive traffic to your site it she's
giving it to you for free so one of the

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.280
things that I would recommend here for
the people watching this is to make sure

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:06.530
to go ahead and go to traffic generation
Kathy and check out the things that is

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.909
teaching on her site because the things
that she's teaching must obviously be

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:17.119
working and you're able to learn about
all that stuff for free and she told you

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.659
right now and her answer that she's not
spending all her time on her site doing

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:28.460
some type of card sales pitch trying to
get you to buy stuff she doesn't like

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.650
selling she doesn't want to do sales is
something that just happens it's a

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:39.259
deadly or so make sure that you do check
out her site and read the information

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.680
that she has there to learn about how
you can drive more traffic to your site

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.060
as well because obviously in just
approximately one hour conversation

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.759
we're only gonna be able to cover so
much here and I know how long have you

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:00.729
been running this traffic generation
kept a site so it she's got four years

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.939
worth articles in she did mention
earlier about the idea of what you need

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.690
to do is 20% content creation and then
eighty percent

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.370
marketing that transcends used to follow
that same ratio and now with your

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.390
constant or are you getting enough
traffic to your site that you really can

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.500
focus more on let me just produced
content as I've already got people

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.860
coming to my site

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:32.870
well for marcia never ends it doesn't
matter what level you are and they look

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.450
at Manish is still promoting and she is
at the point where she actually taking

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.110
your client's because she does but
creating the buzz about our business

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:51.470
never end so that I still follow the
racial I published at least once a week

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.670
a traffic generation cafe mostly because
I do on Saturdays suppose all week

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:04.030
markings and that's where I just get my
reader suggestions on what happened to

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:11.460
the marketing industry and what kind of
news that their business and they could

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:17.739
come and learn everything that he missed
during the week and it's very very handy

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:25.950
for a publish that at least once a week
in there so that's weekly and then maybe

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.560
I publish another

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:36.000
so as you can see I don't publish I
don't write content all the time in

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.200
right now sitting and writing a blog
post on here talking to you mark and she

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.640
yours because it's important because it
never does

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:56.390
you see all the big bloggers out there
are called tranches plans because it's

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.410
not important because it never ends

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:05.600
you know nobody sits morals and say okay
not enough money making and mining will

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:16.620
just follow you always have to 80% of
the time was whatever it is that's out

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.459
there now with its content

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:26.160
your product or service whatever it is
it never ends

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:32.240
absolutely agreed and just like saying
not only is she here talking to me right

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:38.970
now but obviously I'm here talking to
her right now and so what that means I'm

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:44.069
not doing is the right now I'm not
creating blog post I'm not adding new

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:48.210
lecture obtaining courses I'm not
working on creating another course and

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:54.120
you know I do a prep session or these
interviews that goes into the interviews

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.400
aside from doing the interview then
there's the follow-up time that I once

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.650
the interview in the replay is ready and
I'll get the stuff so there's all this

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:11.090
activity that we need to put in a round
between the marketing and hey I'm at the

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.720
very beginning of this and I gotta tell
you it's something that I had to come

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.380
around you because I made that same
mistake when I found out about you to me

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.560
I'm gonna go to use these courses I'm
gonna put him in the marketplace i'm

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.900
start selling the courses in his big fat
zero for me and I had to take a step

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.110
back and realize I don't have an
audience I don't have that know like and

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.229
trust I don't have been established at
expertise and I need to get out there

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:43.210
and do more to establish a personal
brand into getting some recognition in

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:49.449
so I had to recalibrate the things that
I've done is well to say okay yeah I

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:51.729
could keep banging my head against the
wall

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:55.900
producing more and more content but if
it's not true sixty sails I'm just

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.650
spinning my wheels and I've gotta be
willing to put in some more time to

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:06.289
build a relationship to that expertise
in to be doing those marketing things

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:15.370
here and so you can see that I'm totally
on board because these are the things

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:20.759
that I'm that I'm doing right now let's
see if I've got one quick thing I don't

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:24.610
know that we'll be able to one more
thing in here in five minutes

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:30.800
without running over so I'm gonna look
over what I got here in my notes quickly

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.930
to see if there is one last comment

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:38.509
we can make to wrap things up here

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:51.530
David put yours on black right now and
he's someone who does the job without

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:59.340
ever promoting it and building kind of
the Lions most likely without him ever

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:06.810
having to ask but I see him where I mean
all blogs social media Discussions it's

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:13.409
hard to expertise extends out so well

00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:23.520
John glass David you know he you wait
sessions free Google Analytics session

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:35.500
with me all the things that I'm doing
right and wrong that it keeps that

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.259
eventually work paid off

00:07:37.259 --> 00:07:42.569
lab right now and says hey how can I
make money off right

00:07:42.569 --> 00:07:48.699
hang out here because he wants to learn
what she wants to be around he was in

00:07:48.699 --> 00:07:55.129
and it's perfect that's what we all meet
you all the time he's promoting his

00:07:55.129 --> 00:08:05.279
business without promoting himself right
now because I really does work wonders I

00:08:05.279 --> 00:08:09.279
think that's a nice way to wrap things
up here in folks if you look at the jet

00:08:09.279 --> 00:08:15.349
stream actually this is a perfect ending
to this black cast right now because

00:08:15.349 --> 00:08:22.469
David came into the lab said here's
david on the black he's promoting

00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:27.259
himself without having to promote him
she catches my attention of this person

00:08:27.259 --> 00:08:32.909
here she's getting some respect him and
so I just a note to the lab so I need to

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:37.779
do a blood test with you and he comes
back and says I'd love to do it so

00:08:37.779 --> 00:08:43.169
I can't come up with a better way to
wrap this up here then they did you just

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:48.420

action that we've got a new relationship

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:53.019
