00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:34.740
stop rambling about myself here and do a
quick introduction of my guest today

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:43.049
Minh runs a no nonsense traffic
generation cafe where she freely shares

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:50.280
advice on getting more web traffic by
all means possible like SEO traffic

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:57.369
social media traffic in blog promotion
as well as converting that traffic into

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:07.380
email subscribers and customers so
welcome to the show really happy to have

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.860
you on

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:17.360
so you got the traffic generation a blog
about how to generate raft of those site

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.850
but in our prep session you let me in on
that insider information that in fact

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.250
this is not your first log that you ever
runs so tell us about your experience

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:40.340
with some other blogs that you prior to
the traffic generation well logging was

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.750
all about a lot of you might be able to
relate to that he was one of those areas

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.620
where told you to log because he is just
that's what everybody else does and

00:02:52.620 --> 00:03:02.920
that's ok I'm going to start one and
then you write a few things and then it

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.150
kind of sit and wait and try to figure
out so now what

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:17.820
so that's sort of what I did that I was
trying to do about five years ago and it

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.850
really didn't go anywhere and it was no
surprise because literally I just saw it

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:29.860
first of all I didn't know what to write
about right I just wrote whatever I just

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:39.890
waited like there was no one reading and
also may be blogging is not all about

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:50.890
you just go out there and somehow I mean
now about it kind of makes I'll but I

00:03:50.890 --> 00:04:04.510
know that's what they do he started and
he waited for a while and I started

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:13.990
blogging

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:33.950
what is it that I know why is it so is
where I would like to but not all

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:47.600
everywhere but your blogs really you
know you put up and then paste and let

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:56.360
people know we are so I was kind of
learning early on and learning but how

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:05.840
that works out to drive traffic to know
just how they're doing and what they

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:25.840
have so much other people want you know
that before starting a blog really

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:34.800
wasn't at least I couldn't find one sent
request that will talk about traffic and

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:46.930
especially free traffic because you know
very little cash on me drive traffic the

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:54.910
wrong so I can indeed research was not
block the did what I wanted to read and

00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:05.400
mind you I was like I don't have time on
our reading in five thousand where those

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:13.760
asked him so i'm looking for you just
like yesterday so couldn't find it and

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:20.080
that's how traffic generation it was so
that's a long wait

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:28.789
the short answer very good and described
is exactly what a lot of us I know a lot

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:33.310
of the audience here right now our
instructors are wanted you to be

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:37.210
instructors so we can focus it on a lot
of his experiences you to meet

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:41.439
structures is this idea just like you
said oh I'm gonna create a blog and then

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:42.629
I'm gonna wait for traffic

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:47.580
a lot of instructors will create of
course I'm gonna put it up on you and

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:52.430
then I'm gonna wait for all the sales so
if it's not the blog that we've done

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:58.139
we've made that mistake that same type
of thing with our our courses put it up

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:03.310
there and then we sit around and then
there's the islands of you know nothing

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:10.219
happening in NBC we can get taken aback
and we wonder like what's going on here

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:17.460
what happens this this isn't what I was
expecting and then to another one of

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:23.069
your points that you made that highs in
very well is what you started doing your

00:07:23.069 --> 00:07:30.529
research you started actually building
knowledge about a particular topic and

00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:38.569
it was a topic did you we had very much
of an interest in any old thing out

00:07:38.569 --> 00:07:44.690
there that you realize that you needed
to worry about generating traffic and

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:51.139
you studied it in interest in it and
then your point that to the best of your

00:07:51.139 --> 00:07:58.339
knowledge there was no blog was doing
that at the time I would say that that's

00:07:58.339 --> 00:08:01.990
a fair statement to make because if
there were a blog that was doing that

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:05.770
then obviously they weren't doing a good
job because you weren't aware you didn't

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:12.389
really know what they were talking about
so they gave you yet another opportunity

00:08:12.389 --> 00:08:17.430
to do something even if there are blogs
that are out there they must not be

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:21.229
doing something right opportunity to do
something different that's going to make

00:08:21.229 --> 00:08:28.459
my blog successful so just in those
moments where you described to us how

00:08:28.459 --> 00:08:33.209
you can be dropped generation there are
so many parallels

00:08:33.209 --> 00:08:38.099
for people who are looking to start and
you to me and it's not you need to start

00:08:38.099 --> 00:08:42.669
on line with any type digital product or
digital enterprise and it's all the

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:48.819
great stuff for us to think about what
it is that you that you described to us

00:08:48.819 --> 00:08:54.939
about how you came to traffic generation
kept they so let's continue the

00:08:54.939 --> 00:09:00.220
discussion little bit more than so you
did a lot of research about generating

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:04.819
traffic you were looking at how to
generate free traffic and you actually

00:09:04.819 --> 00:09:11.240
mentioned some specifics in there about
the ideas of hanging out on other

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.470
people's blogs

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:16.179
there's a learning tool to see what they
were doing that you weren't doing and

00:09:16.179 --> 00:09:19.019
then there's also I know another
component about what you do when you

00:09:19.019 --> 00:09:19.559
hang out

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:26.550
logs so we're starting to get
information here that we can dig into

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:32.809
deeper hear about ok so what are these
three traffic generation techniques so

00:09:32.809 --> 00:09:34.119
which one would you like to start with
