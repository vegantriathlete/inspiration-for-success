00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.570
right so I think we can talk about mana
Steffensen who you haven't reviewed

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:17.940
weeks ago and it was a very good example
on social media to meet with her

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:25.449
expertise and even though getting there
I'm not her client and she takes

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:34.100
generation runs in the background work
as plug-ins everything related to the

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:45.930
runs what makes a site and run smoothly
she does so that's that's what should

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:54.510
the US and the way I noticed was number
one on her comments on my post they were

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.579
extremely dictate and she was very I
mean it was hard not to notice for

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:12.520
knowledge was anything and plant makes
it especially me know I my own log I

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.570
mean I didn't appreciate at the time was
a lot of work we're not meant all of our

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.479
own outsourced tasks like web design or
security or whatever it is that you

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:42.990
don't feel like you are and so she juice
he's an experienced and that may be

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:59.579
noticed another thing which is a roundup
not quite a lot of things happened in

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:12.140
areas you know update you all gates
whatever D

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:20.300
you run a better side she talks about
and she started mentioning are quick to

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:26.700
insist the industry Tuesdays and 12 my
name mentioned as they can't be wrong

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:35.500
Google+ or wherever there's always
always always that blog and make sure

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:42.670
that I read the article and share it
because it's mentioned somewhere so when

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:54.750
somebody makes the effort so between
comments and then we might actually just

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:02.030
lifted for me and I asked her to traffic
generation gap for me in the past year

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.150
and a half TV or something like that but
again all of that started it all social

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:17.519
media first of all in all of it starting
expert in what she does not dropping the

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:24.019
just being there and helping my floor
some social media when the head

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:29.739
WordPress related questions that I
either didn't have sufficient knowledge

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:35.519
to respond to my cell or just have time
to get to them in time and she did that

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:42.230
so those teeth made hers and meet and I
repeat client and you have to remember

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:54.790
that invest in building trust so be
prepared but once you do that there's no

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:02.910
timeframe how long will take you to but
once you put in the effort to establish

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.310
expertise around the web

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:14.130
not just on your side you see the
clients achieve you people will be

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:20.440
talking about you your invention ever
with a guy and then we'll be everywhere

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.250
and that what you

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:33.640
mom promotion and business elite and no
money so that's sort of what happened

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:43.630
it's a great story too because like you
mentioned it did take a couple years and

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:50.030
it's not like me and he gave up on it in
was so mercenary about this like oh I

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.810
said all these nice things about yet
still she's not she just and I don't

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.640
even think that that's the way that me
and I would have approached it anyway I

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.450
don't even know whether she would have
had in the back of her mind that she was

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.430
doing this because she was trying to
build a relationship with you that could

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:12.970
result in the fact that you would ask
her to run your website for you I think

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:18.980
she was probably engage with you because
she was truly interested in you in in so

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:24.419
there wasn't this kind of clock ticking
where she did I get the return on

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:28.790
investment here so it's still again
comes back to something that may enter

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:33.790
was building a relationship with you
because she had a genuine interest in

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:39.590
what you were doing she wasn't just
randomly going out to places to say let

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.919
me try to stroke this person's ego
stroke that person's you go let me see

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:49.870
if I just like make myself for them in
then see whether they'll do something in

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:55.400
exchange for me man is not on right now
so we can ask her directly how she

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.010
happened to find out about traffic
generation Kathy but I would imagine she

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:04.510
thought about it some organic fashion
and in the end you captured her

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:11.210
interests and she started engaging with
you we've got just under 20 minutes to

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.890
an hour so I wanna give you the
opportunity

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:19.870
people are watching us now if you want
to ask questions please make sure that

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:24.600
you post your questions in the stream so
that we can have the opportunity to

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:31.250
answer them before time runs out I will
talk with some more things here but it's

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.830
probably going to be another one or two
questions that I'll be able to ask her

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.689
many times so there's a question

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:43.860
you want to ask make sure that you into
the stream there I'm gonna go ahead and

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:49.489
ask one more question and I will open up
a seat if people want to be able to sit

00:06:49.489 --> 00:06:58.729
down in question of her directly so now
I gotta gather my thoughts here to see

00:06:58.729 --> 00:07:08.769
what the question was oh yes so is far
as his situation so she had mentioned to

00:07:08.769 --> 00:07:15.169
us that this traffic generation cafe
came into existence because she did

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:22.819
develop an interest in how do you
generate traffic and she is generating

00:07:22.819 --> 00:07:28.739
traffic on her site and you know she's
got the attention of people but we

00:07:28.739 --> 00:07:34.949
haven't actually gotten to the
discussion here's ok she's got this

00:07:34.949 --> 00:07:39.110
traffic generation Kathy she's built her
reputation her sights moved up in the

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:40.110
rankings

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:45.779
you know and then there's the big
question that comes down to is a but

00:07:45.779 --> 00:07:49.610
doesn't make you any money right because
obviously we're all here we're in

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:53.789
business in yet we want to build
relationships and the like and trust

00:07:53.789 --> 00:07:58.659
that all the stuff and we need to be
able to support ourselves and our our

00:07:58.659 --> 00:08:06.999
bills here so how do you go about making
how do you know what you're doing with

00:08:06.999 --> 00:08:16.449
with your blog so I have to start with
his absolutely horrible at making money

00:08:16.449 --> 00:08:23.559
it's not my forte I don't like doing it
out like any activity is he

00:08:23.559 --> 00:08:34.550
money-making strategist so great is
everything that I talk to you about just

00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:41.759
I have talked about in 45 minutes it
just goes to show that building the

00:08:41.759 --> 00:08:47.509
trust and building relationships works
now closed for making money off you

00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:49.889
online online business

00:08:49.889 --> 00:08:57.459
I don't actively anything the only thing
that has worked is affiliate marketing I

00:08:57.459 --> 00:09:05.369
don't even though acted in several times
to create my own product much higher

00:09:05.369 --> 00:09:11.160
gotta have time for something that
somebody else created and some of the

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:16.859
affiliate marketing commissions are
exceptional its 50% 75% you know people

00:09:16.859 --> 00:09:26.160
put in the effort to make them and then
reap the benefits of marketing perfect

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:34.259
works well I only recommend products
that actually and I know that's a very

00:09:34.259 --> 00:09:38.759
important and then I have trust in a
relationship

00:09:38.759 --> 00:09:46.449
around myself that people that under
traffic generation cafe not no longer

00:09:46.449 --> 00:09:53.439
traffic because most likely the hit me
either people and money here no word of

00:09:53.439 --> 00:09:55.600
mouth works wonders

00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:01.129
you know they're already won by the fact
that I mean no one knows what they're

00:10:01.129 --> 00:10:18.189
lucky and I'm still must be there so the
things that you need to build your

00:10:18.189 --> 00:10:27.459
presence outside outside and create that
experts around you

00:10:27.459 --> 00:10:35.389
Indian dish you have your own product
sell services even if you ads on your

00:10:35.389 --> 00:10:36.419
website

00:10:36.419 --> 00:10:44.079
really does that come ready to know you
and then there are more likely to follow

00:10:44.079 --> 00:11:01.019
the links and the don't feel like asking
like I asked her if she leaves because I

00:11:01.019 --> 00:11:01.660
trusted

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:06.950
so much if I asked him because she never
mentioned but she didn't mention the

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:13.540
services and she has something so I
asked her so people will be asking you

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:19.750
what it is at least you take my money
because you are the expert here clearly

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:26.310
any just services so that's a wonderful
thing about running business that way

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:29.650
you know just building it up

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:34.020
ask you for anything in return and then
people will be offering you money cheap

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:39.830
buy whatever it is that you have to sell
again you know going back to traffic

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:46.030
generation Kathy affiliate marketing is
my forte that's how I make money I you

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:51.680
know I could make more money for effort
into it I don't want you but until you

00:11:51.680 --> 00:12:01.910
know a couple years ago my husband
happened and my job was being until he

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:11.760
found a new one you know so that's
nothing I feel it thinks they're just so

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:19.560
you know just again I can't stress
enough the expert and expertise so much

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:24.220
but that's what it comes down to a huge
sneak you tell people that know what

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:31.160
youre talking about and they work and
there will be money you get that their

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:31.370
side
