00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.260
just don't cut me loose let me see where
it all leads ok but anyways site right

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:21.490
so I started just not hey friend areas
where bloggers I was a few other

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:30.330
bloggers were older people who online
marketers in online business owners had

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:38.000
a block and the need to drive traffic to
so quickly realized it blocking or block

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:47.780
lotion not necessarily bout will now but
more about who knows and who knows what

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:55.530
he do so if you if you spend enough time
and put on a lot of bessmertnykh gonna

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:09.979
have to give me know very true that
logging is all about not 2008 so those

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:19.759
pieces of constant focus very good at
them to the point where they don't talk

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:29.009
radio there and start conversations
about what you blog about you know so

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.060
you are showing their knowledge and you
don't really have to tell you all that

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:45.860
much once you do that because they know
what they're doing because we all want

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:54.520
on-line that all you know all the
bloggers who will listen like they know

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:01.520
what they're talking about because
everybody else around us so that's your

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.190
objective is number one she know what
she don't open your mom I'm less

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:19.040
add comment section blog post or social
media discussion with flaps were in a

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:28.040
lot people jumping in a row 12 seat is
open just add to the discussion so

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:36.900
probably not the best expertise and a
focus on that so once you got people

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:44.050
will and mind you that's even before the
website where they even know what you

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:54.520
see your face you know something is
coming out of the mosque preferably and

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:01.270
get to know you know your business and
that's what you want and mind you this

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.950
might take awhile you know this is not
going to happen overnight there are some

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:14.670
strategies that I can share with you
that I have you basically made traffic

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:22.420
generation cafe look like it was it was
there and it was only like a month and

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:31.500
are not seeing all the rides that focus
on sharing losses on Twitter back one

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:40.320
day started one of the drivers you don't
know that I got you are quite well on at

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:46.150
the same time in saudi he came to my dog
when he left a comment I had no idea

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:53.120
that this month old I thought you were
here so in his mind even though only

00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:01.530
hurt me about a month back then fell to
him like he knew me forever because

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:08.989
people talking about and my dog and I
was very exceptional the people I had

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:15.450
that feeling that I know what I'm
talking and trust

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:23.380
so that I want to share with you as far
as how I did what I did with traffic

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:30.520
generation Kathy what you see in the
tide is that it had reached home because

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.770
they weren't there were reeling because
they actually work back then I had no

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:41.690
idea that that was a good I just tried
it sounded like a good idea to try this

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:48.250
try up so basically there are two things
that I did first of all Twitter was very

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:58.040
big back then again you know but it was
all the buses all marketers were there

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:08.280
so so I know everybody I want to see you
there and that's why I need to be and

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:15.050
the first thing that I did was I did
nothing to you have to understand if you

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:25.979
spread like what's a major platforms
such as Twitter Facebook Google Plus

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:33.970
LinkedIn depending on what kind of
business you so that's five if you try

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:40.330
to be on a leash meaning legislating
account and in all share a couple of

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:50.250
links to your own continent so but not
enough of you so don't read that that's

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:57.919
why focus and I gave myself a goal 30
days 30 I'm going to learn everything

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:06.250
there is to know where you are going to
get to know people share their constant

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:13.870
another thing that I did is so the point
is you have to give something that they

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:19.370
want and it has to be something it's not
about cue just very difficult for us you

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:24.830
must do for some reason because you're
not gonna be read a post

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:30.250
and he said very very

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:34.290
don't ask people to follow you on
twitter

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:41.560
just also and there will be no not so
easy to say and to do but that's the

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:46.230
gist of it you know you not on Twitter
and other social media to tell people he

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.040
here are so great

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:55.420
got some expert that people don't want
that the one here about themselves so

00:06:55.420 --> 00:07:05.240
what I didn't I created a message that
was sent off and that's Rep message said

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:10.570
something like he so glad you followed
me into traffic generation Kathy and

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:18.890
promote your business at this thing and
it was truly about them know I i treated

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:31.810
as a single or blog owners for business
owners she just their business drop

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:37.340
playing a key also was lost now are
dropping leaves was absolutely on that

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:46.720
and people came and they talked and they
were just section now since the comment

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:55.750
section was just getting not shoe so I
stopped away from that because that

00:07:55.750 --> 00:08:00.650
strategy worked for a long time but I
didn't any longer

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:08.630
eight-hour my Twitter promotion so but
it was there for a while and we needed a

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:17.280
lot of traffic generated a lot of
traffic and people stayed because it was

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:25.800
a lot of conversation was the largest
fashion and stuck around the start of my

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:33.550
email list but again the number one
strategy here was it will be worth our

00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:36.900
time that will be bought them reading
them

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:45.770
your blog your business was really
really I just happened to stumble upon

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:52.940
and after I did that I saw a lot of
wrongdoing and you know once everybody

00:08:52.940 --> 00:09:00.390
starts fucking you it's not the same
anymore but milk it for all its worth

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:11.620
while so that's one thing that I learned
everything about it

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:19.320
30 days please after you master
automated as much as possible I remember

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:32.650
you human element out of your day online
but as well so you know direct messages

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:44.040
can automate that so does little tasks
not have to be present

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:58.370
have to ask her client's and and I need
a sitter you can have coffee there get

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:04.950
your throat a little bit so ok so
another strategy that would suggest that

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:06.360
work for me

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:12.640
wonderfully and there was one of the
reasons why foundered no don't kill my

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:21.290
dog and he said it looked like I told
you I hung around for a while just to

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:26.730
see what other people were doing so as a
hundred other blogs I noticed there was

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:28.910
a second group of people

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:36.700
walkers that and they were good currents
were you know the elected so I thought

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.290
they were

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:45.570
starting stages of their business or
about the same level business level that

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:52.329
I am you know just trying to build up
their business so I approached about and

00:10:52.329 --> 00:10:59.170
I said how bout we know everybody some
tribes I didn't call it it was like a

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:15.009
common to create I created called
loggers was there was an error that but

00:11:15.009 --> 00:11:18.069
in a very

00:11:18.069 --> 00:11:25.500
was not there were no it was not enough
that accountability was and the point

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:32.660
was not just a superficial common but
started discussion feedback as well it

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:39.699
was somewhat of a mastermind as where
you know if the blog post isn't working

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:48.860
encouraged each other that well on this
post published right off the bat at

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:50.610
least Commons

00:11:50.610 --> 00:12:00.920
work we need and at least shares and
created a lot of social right away so

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:09.000
that was a lot of very good and I and
after even after about six months we

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:18.959
really do need anymore because that
presence just automatically but was

00:12:18.959 --> 00:12:25.709
still and then I think I handed it over
to another young walker so that she can

00:12:25.709 --> 00:12:29.880
continue because I couldn't do it
anymore I had too much traffic ahead to

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:40.970
deal with comments where organic common
space but that works very well as it

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:48.319
doesn't have to be a mean don't want
direct competitors right people who are

00:12:48.319 --> 00:12:54.699
generally in the state talk about the
same on their sides as you are because

00:12:54.699 --> 00:12:59.279
obviously you want you know what you're
talking about when you comment on their

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:13.139
sites but that works a small are allowed
and you know because I don't comment if

00:13:13.139 --> 00:13:17.800
the don't pull their hair then find
another one so
