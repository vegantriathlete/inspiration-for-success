00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.009
ok so there you go sees an anti-aids he
gets into the fog photography and of its

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.620
action here as Marx getting into
businesses like who got him into the

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.019
business deserves the theme that's going
to run through here as well so they get

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:23.619
in seeing this guy and photography and
videography in then from there

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.019
tell us a little bit about how that came
into play with your SME heroes what does

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.399
that have to do with it a bit on live
twelve years so we did a lot of Mopti

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:41.329
things you have to learn if you want to
succeed online is good marketing and we

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.440
soon realized that there was a lot of
stuff going on

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:52.520
online and one of the things I became
particularly when Google+ came out to

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.320
use at all to myself as you that for
local SEO outsourcing Google+ came who's

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.859
extremely how businesses when used in
the right way I started really get into

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.720
that they realize after a little while
this was service offering but we have a

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:15.060
couple of friends are already running a
website business and they were in social

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.780
media marketing as well but maybe not as
much as actually I was so we decided to

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.659
come to get reform destiny he wrote
songs for in that business and then so

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.590
then what we can offer was i would be
doing a lot of the direct marketing

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.960
online Luke would be doing the Web
Design Star was charged or content that

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.350
type of thing

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.759
philomena was in charge of video card do
photography woman needs and we actually

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.670
positioned herself in the market as
someone who can actually deliver a mob

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.869
scene because one of the things we
notice a lot of people get website let

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.380
people get to talk to a lot of people in
video wasn't wasn't working together so

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.590
that's how we got into that so we just
realized you called us girls together

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.460
that would be exact I can do a little
bit you know I can do a little bit of

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:06.140
coding on a website but I'm not a
website designer got loose in a cave is

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.030
not my characters six in a cave

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.540
forum a project and out comes this
amazing website looks brilliant

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.660
functions correctly you know and so that
basically have worked with a team that

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:26.319
we work on that and what happened was we
was doing a lot of video marketing video

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.640
marketing was doing a lot of free
content and create free training for

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:42.820
people and somehow we have and then so
that's where we were the LA tomorrow so

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.850
that brings us to how we started
creating training material because we

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:55.390
will create training with your phone
business right so that the Dead's

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.519
getting us really closer to the
discussion

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:05.090
the sales funnels and some you to meet
specific talk so how did you end up

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.950
getting like what was your training
materials and you're doing you know this

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:20.060
other stuff here so so you came up with
it comes back in a few different

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.680
business trying to do different things
and businesses changes you set them up

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.049
you know they will I will adapt and
you'll find in each never seems to end

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.570
up where it started and 21 days

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:44.290
website and it shows how is made like
$90,000

00:03:44.290 --> 00:04:03.709
traditional understanding I checked it
out

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:11.519
reluctantly and then all of a sudden I
looked enough gas if you have another

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:12.640
chance Karen

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:19.260
i watch you pat flynn stuff lots of
people to create online residual income

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:30.160
chief source of inspiration from Intel
and you know I realized that you know in

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.870
the past we wanted to develop we were
thinking typical bricks and mortar and a

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:43.370
problem with offline residual income to
invest money so you can invest anything

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.950
over the money and you have to have
money to make money off and then when I

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:49.919
clicked

00:04:49.919 --> 00:05:06.520
you know what time for money which is
very inefficient create digital product

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:14.580
take that digital product and repeatedly
now you've got a former residual income

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.370
nice I'm saying residual income not
passive residual there is a difference

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.979
and I think passive income is a bit
misleading residual income exactly what

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:36.979
would develop am so very simple website
creation antiques calls on that guy and

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:43.500
then that brings us to you to me is how
did we come to you to me while Monday

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:53.669
philomena comes to the credit of
inspiration to keep coming in because

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:58.050
she's always trying to figure out the
best way to make money is really gonna

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:05.289
find you to me says its massive
marketplace so we took around six goals

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:14.789
and we put a new to me and we started
out selling it was really quick work

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:18.910
hard to drive traffic to your own
website and that's how we came to you to

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:30.410
me so put the first course up straight
away and once you get no sales and then

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:34.810
since then it's just been a case of
figuring out how do you do me

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:45.510
business which we're done and you know
we are coming to the place now where we

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:49.690
even considering giving up a service by
side of the business because the online

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:54.729
training is doing so well is actually
sooner costs money to actually do it

00:06:54.729 --> 00:06:59.650
people around so that's really
interesting and you know it was already

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:05.470
talking about hiking prices a lot
because we have to you know and that's

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:15.250
the success is not working so that's
basically how we can ok so here we are

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:22.510
you mean you're saying that the first
chorus issue could have you got a lot of

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:28.750
other clusters of course is not only to
steal your thunder hear how you done

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:33.110
your sales they too much more about that
I'm so you have a lot more besides just

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:39.880
these up in your kind of figured out how
do you do you so tell us a little bit

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:46.240
about that like how how are you doing
how head you put the pieces together and

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:54.870
here's what I realized that a first step
is you have to treat you as a business

00:07:54.870 --> 00:08:04.099
that's the first thing that people make
is there for you to me and that's how I

00:08:04.099 --> 00:08:09.169
think you know me and nothing wrong in
that you can do that but if you want to

00:08:09.169 --> 00:08:13.970
really getting to me is going to be a
business is a business and it's

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:19.470
somewhere between every other business
you gotta figure out of business and you

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:26.849
gonna do you have to take courses you
have to listen to try different things

00:08:26.849 --> 00:08:30.349
and that's the first thing if you
remember when I said at the beginning

00:08:30.349 --> 00:08:39.610
the first business we're an online it's
even make money I was losing money hand

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:49.740
over fist and what was one day I realize
what I was doing i buy loads of stuff

00:08:49.740 --> 00:09:04.079
and then what happened I wasn't making
any money and why are they making money

00:09:04.079 --> 00:09:09.850
and I'm not and that's really important
question to ask in any business is over

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:13.459
people making money doing what you're
doing and you're not there something

00:09:13.459 --> 00:09:30.199
wrong and then one day we met less
horrible than even know who it was early

00:09:30.199 --> 00:09:46.829
days by the time it ended but you know
what I did was I went and brought all

00:09:46.829 --> 00:09:51.980
the books I could find on that item and
i learn about item and it was Chinese

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:55.850
ports and news late 19th century export
Chinese porcelain

00:09:55.850 --> 00:10:01.939
hunting and that was a core of our
business and then what would happen we

00:10:01.939 --> 00:10:09.069
would develop i buy something else and
that would go crazy by books I would buy

00:10:09.069 --> 00:10:16.579
you know I spent on my Chinese possible
to time these books of banks probably

00:10:16.579 --> 00:10:26.120
invested in the end of books on
education and that's the key thing to do

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:33.449
that and that's what it's really educate
yourself to success so that's how we got

00:10:33.449 --> 00:10:39.769
there about niches and developing needed
because

00:10:39.769 --> 00:10:42.110
we started selling into a neat we start
making money
