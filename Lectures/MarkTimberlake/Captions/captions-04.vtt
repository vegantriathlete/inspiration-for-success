00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.060

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.050
make sure we get all the good stuff here

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.299
near talking about marketing and that
helped help the people tie all this

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:19.240
together now with this whole idea of
your sales funnels in the what are you

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.430
doing with these things you know how
your sales with your marketing how to

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.680
your free courses work with your sales
funnels you got into courses you got

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.920
whatever you said twenty-something
thirty-something courses on you to me at

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.710
this point how do all these pieces now
come together with his overarching see

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:46.980
that's the key so the system I teaches
the simplest system out that I i know it

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.510
was developed in the late 19th century
as a copy writing technique but it's

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.430
actually very good marketing online
marketing its kool aid and anyone who

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:04.030
knows me knows I'm little and eventually
this is the this is the principal this

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.770
is a principle when someone buys
anything for state process and if you

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.740
can match your marketing for state
process you will draw declines to you

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:23.360
want to buy your product and that some
attention interest desire action both in

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.890
your client's attention then you have to
develop interest then you have to

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:34.490
develop their desire to take action so
that's a simple marketing so then you

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.659
would match that your marketing strategy
so attention and there's two types of

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.500
marketing funnel we can talk about a new
to me there's an internal marketing

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:51.130
funnel and as an external most people
are not taking advantage of violence but

00:01:51.130 --> 00:02:02.350
as to action to funnel the best

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:24.800

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.709
up with these really complex else from
all three break it down you'll see

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:20.290

elements of desire for calls to action

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:35.489

you got too much internal you mark so

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:43.519

we'd because you are present

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:16.850
there's no awareness of students about

in your sector

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:41.960
introductory courses you know you've
just done you've just circumvented

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:52.540
always looking for caution on the free

00:05:50.229 --> 00:06:00.540
people misses the subject and you do
things subject you as an expert on your

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:06.990
education so they come in on a three
course we gonna get paid for the free

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:15.390
course now people are highly relevant

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:20.980
finding your intrested advertising and
you've got his captive audience of

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:25.030
people are really interesting your stuff

you know we just makes it so easy

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:40.080
because this content marketing for a
long time you bring people back and I

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:53.140
think so what can you do now promotes
anything you want your services now you

00:06:53.140 --> 00:07:11.710
courses that banks course in your free
call people who have gone for your free

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:16.900
course and they liked it enough to buy
these people will buy from you forever

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:25.160
and i can see I see their names they
come in is now his cum into bought my

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:36.100
free course then clusters I'm actually
delivering value and appreciate it

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:41.740
enough to buy my product so we've got
back hold marketing final at the way

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:52.510
almost anything we've got left is and so
one who buys my course encourage them to

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:58.330
the end he buys another course but each
of my courses which might cause classes

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:06.200
has a minimum of four courses in that
subject area by 10 happens everytime i

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:11.220
buy all those and then eventually they
drift into some of my stuff so one free

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:17.230
course leading into four courses often
means when someone comes from all four

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:22.760
courses now YouTube internal market
never really interesting tip of a free

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:26.849
course them emotionally educationally
well

00:08:26.849 --> 00:08:30.149
so this is what you do create a free
course

00:08:30.149 --> 00:08:39.430
regular live streaming events things
like this where people can come and chat

00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:50.870
and jump in and you're allowed to send
education courses so

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:56.250
Mayumi courses somebody asked me when I
do get so many people watching her get

00:08:56.250 --> 00:09:04.310
so many people because you know I get
fifty people watching simple because I

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:18.220
just probably eight thousand people you
know about 21,000 students now because I

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:25.660
send you know an announcement wanted and
now they're engaging with me off of you

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:31.339
to me not breaking any rules of
completely passed this is not tricking

00:09:31.339 --> 00:09:40.220
anybody or break in the system you have
given this full support for now they're

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:46.579
engaging with me but think about this my
free course

00:09:46.579 --> 00:09:53.290
educational so now I'm getting them to
engage me now live and now I can sit

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:59.130
down and it's the same principle
questions they can really test me don't

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:08.259
know I'm talking about myself and we're
just educating them again about the

00:10:08.259 --> 00:10:15.579
subject and about my expertise in the
subject because I'm a marketing company

00:10:15.579 --> 00:10:19.189
that sells training courses
