people never think I just wanted to the
real hero yes is a general term paper

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.340
crane course that's really interesting
when you go through to you to be course

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:24.199
creation process something really subtle
happens is they actually teach you how

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:30.630
to create course as you go through the
process so it's almost worth going

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.960
through the process of training course
on youtube if you even if we never sell

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.620
it on your own website you're gonna know
how to structure of course properly

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:52.600
process they take you through the
process and yes I'm just gonna

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:59.280
people are interested in the business
course we mentioned earlier let me just

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:07.070
bring that up so now when you you
automatically contemporary yeah yes I

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:14.000
want you create a unique course there's
a as a function in a coupon code

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.310
generator URL just tagged with your code
so you shared that and all the revenue

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.780
that you then receive from not link
people come to that Lang NASA Bintang

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:34.740
Biophilia which is no discussion is
yours so minus three percent which is a

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:46.240
paper ok that's meant at so you know me
only 23 percent on your promotions and

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:57.490
my promotion yes if they sell it now if
they thought what's the 2013 I don't

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:05.079
understand and then if any attacks your
coupon code this upsets people upset if

yes you are on eBay said for many years
at the end

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:18.790
IDB years ago 2001 out I was trained

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:26.160
with transitioning out of that and into
my health and nutrition so in that

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:34.800
interim our belly while I loved it i
loved this is probably when you are

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.450
making a killing that maybe after I
don't know how long were you on ebay I i

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.740
came up about two years ago

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:51.610
oh ok all right so you what you wanted a
long time twelve years and you know it

00:03:51.610 --> 00:04:00.770
when you have a ditch somewhere I mean I
need Bay yeah yeah you know I D for us

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:06.700
you know the antiques is a song that
couple of factors when Donahoe came in

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.180
and took over the eBay business head he
wanted to try to email Amazon and all of

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.430
a sudden selling antiques and
collectibles wasn't very popular amongst

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.109
the eBay management so nice or Faisal

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:27.849
made the recession but it was great we
know when we were in control swing it

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:28.520
was brilliant

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.509
it was absolutely brilliant you know
just to just to bargain hunt and that

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:37.599
was that was a bit I still love the
thrill of finding some time still love

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:45.939
it you know I can still go as he knows
stuff any downside of that was you had

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:53.919
to sell stock to sourcing the stock is a
tough thing you can and that's why I

00:04:53.919 --> 00:05:00.379
love digital products so much because I
create my product and I can sell my

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:06.960
product I've never again but when I was
doing the antiques that was you know I

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.099
have to keep the stock flies are
constantly how a week

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:19.310
individual items all the time it was a
lot of hard work when I go back into

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.509
another want to get back into a just
society at some point I'll be scanned it

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:29.460
right down but it taught me a lot about
online marketing managing customers you

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:36.339
know you know going on eBay you know
being open to customer criticism it

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:43.409
teaches you a lot about how to handle
customers and I mean that the one thing

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:48.659
I didn't like about them so now that I
remember coming back to me you know you

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:55.860
work so hard and getting your positive
rating and one with one negative it

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.879
seems like it will be a hundred people
they would bring you down so far right

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:11.279
down so you would happen ninety-nine
percent approval rating or something and

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:24.419
then 68% I don't know how would you rate
your yeah yeah but we won it was just

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:31.320
you know we always get them you get when
you do me any any marketplace

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.610
you know you just you just managed it
and you just make sure that you did

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:40.190
absolutely nothing you could produce
quality products and service and then

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:49.970
when you get there we have it with some
big chip chip inside the place has a

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:56.660
chip happy you know and and one of the
things we learned that was a really

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:04.900
important is a risk rehearsal and I see
people get so listen you to me as well

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:10.760
so what is risk reversal that's where
they you take the risk so that they

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:17.380
don't have a risk when they buy from you
what happens is the first 30 days they

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.450
can buy your course I'm refunded for any
reason whatsoever

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:26.480
ok and people get a reform of course
they get upset about that what we used

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:36.500
to do with antiques was we used to
refund the price of the item and they

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.510
could return it for any reason
whatsoever

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:43.900
return because they didn't like it and
we would retire paid return postage yeah

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:49.810
so that was what proposition that while
we saw any reason

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:55.680
send it back even pay return postage
yeah bearing in mind that when we used

00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:02.520
to ship stuff to Australia when the
Australians buy stuff they would buy you

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:14.040
know you know five hundred pounds to be
200 pounds we had to post it in the

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:18.220
first place we lost that two hundred
pounds they're paying posted on the way

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:25.620
turnt up and back but the value of
reversing the risk and this is why if

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:32.410
you look at any my promo videos videos
for utme 12 strongest elements just

00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:35.979
before the call to action at the end is
if you are unhappy for any reason

00:08:35.979 --> 00:08:41.260
whatsoever you can get a refund first
five days no questions

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:45.670
because you've got a reverse the risk
and that's really important product as

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:45.740
well
