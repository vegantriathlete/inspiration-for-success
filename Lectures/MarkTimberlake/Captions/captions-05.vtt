00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.220
ok very good so a lot of information
they were almost at 1:45 mark did

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.080
mention about the ability to do these
live chats I mean this is an example of

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.010
a live chat they were doing right now so
I want to do is open up a seat so

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.930
somebody wants to have a chance to sit
down and actually asked the question

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:27.349
directly to us we can do that so I'll go
ahead and unlock this seat here and if

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.810
somebody wants to sit down and take a
seed feel created to jump on and asked

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:40.050
to be admitted it works best if you're
on your own lab is indeed unnoticed in

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.469
the upper left-hand corner there this so
you're not on Chrome trouble there so we

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.520
got about just over 13 minutes left here
I'll leave that seat open and go ahead

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.039
and continue the discussion with mark in
the meantime I want to scroll through

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:02.250
here quickly to make sure if there were
questions that we got around to

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.900
answering the questions I know there was
one about describing

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.710
remember please describe the marketing
funnel is described in internal but I

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.460
think that you didn't answer both of
those can you explain internal internal

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:30.579
and so I think we're good I just tension
interest is a great place to start your

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:39.360
YouTube videos are not necessarily those
people basic problems that's a great way

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:47.299
son external websites email address and
now we've got them on the emails and 10

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.399
most important things you need to build
as a marketing business selling courses

00:01:51.399 --> 00:02:07.570
is your email so here just to make sure
that people are getting the stuff you're

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.319
so the beginning I mentioned

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.599
dad we're going to focus on finals here
there's different types of models and

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:18.359
marks mark has mentioned he's at
external and internal but she also

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:22.959
mentions what markets adheres well
designed the obvious course clusters

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.459
that's another type of a funnel that he
has a place he talked about 800

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.030
attention interest desire in action and
that's a specific type of a marketing

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:39.680
funnel would mark is put together here
with his Chris clusters is another type

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:47.129
of a funnel the course and an
introductory course and by the way just

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:52.090
to reinforce the point it has to be good
when I get off on that whole discussion

00:02:52.090 --> 00:03:00.280
on this topic before I should mention it
but it's got to be good free content is

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:09.150
not just the other final of that in the
you got this other cluster courses that

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:21.060
students can buy in and so three courses
gotta be good quality in that you've got

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.370
the final then of your courses oh shoot
I was just gonna say something I used

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:38.220
Google Hangouts on air so that is
another example of one knows that

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.620
markets using an nudge nudge wink wink
just what I'm doing here with the blacks

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.340
in these interviews that I'm doing is
that you're putting content out there

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.139
that can attract attention of people I
think we got attention of some people

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:56.219
right now wouldn't you say so you use
these labs in you use the Google

00:03:56.219 --> 00:04:02.139
Hangouts on air to help build a tension
into you do you get people to you know

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:05.849
you into like you and to trust you if
you did you know what you're talking

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:06.789
about

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:11.989
read it as does he think working with
you to me is still worth it so you know

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.209
what this is actually a good for a
wrap-up type of a question that I do

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.340
like to do in in these conversations
that I have a people

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.340
because mark does have a lot of course
is on you to me in so let me take

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:31.960
margarines question about this he think
we're with you to make my something that

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:40.169
is the answer is yes in a brazen and if
so what motivates you to keep on

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:51.810
producing people were saying not gonna
work and for many years you know we were

00:04:51.810 --> 00:05:05.260
doing disruptive in antiques business
people very destructive technology you

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:15.620
to me is beginning when you say we
hundred million students that's why

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:23.460
we're arrives early adopters get the
benefit so if you build a business on

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:29.320
