starts coming to people's attention a

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.930
lot of people say about a year ago so
there is a massive wave of people coming

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.679
on at this time of year and I'll be the
same again this year really interesting

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:38.309
program looking into it like about three
years maybe like just started it was at

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:50.020
that time but I didn't have time to put
it together but now now that my video so

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:58.309
it's going to be it's going to be great
I mean I already know that you know I

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:04.930
have it all lines I just need to do
actually yeah yes if anybody's in the

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:11.360
sidebar of opened up your seat so jump
jump in shares discuss its open seats

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.750
they're coming back to your question is
talking about so I know people in the

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:24.509
natural health industry and now you know
teachings or so you can become sort of

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:31.369
principles and that sort of right now I
don't i i i teach people how to get

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.909
nutrients into their body what what
nutrients gonna work best for dealing

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.920
with my history of that have a lot of
people mostly at work with people who

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:50.399
are like I was the last war so people
who have some of my clients were told to

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:58.820
go home and I and then my job was to do
cedar prolong their life and then in the

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:59.829
end

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:03.170
little by little at least eight people
just get healthier how hear how the

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.030
install go away

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:15.490
and i've seen miracles afternoon so I
don't just I am NOT I'm not I don't

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:23.920
promote a way of EDI individual what's
gonna work with that first thing

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:31.800
depending on what the hell yeah I think
obviously there's already a massive

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.870
market for this stuff so you know
whether it is a market on you to me on

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.080
the home ice with this subject becomes
almost irrelevant in the sense that you

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.890
know the market is gonna come to you
what's happening is you know people are

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.459
coming to you to man up on programming
course trees is a great example you know

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:56.250
he's in decide that you know she teaches
you how to make sourdough bread you know

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.500
you can't get him on each than that but
she's already issued a great following

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:06.730
she's brought that business to you to me
now I don't know what are you gonna grow

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.620
beyond where it started so when it
started out it was a lost heck

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:17.370
programming to make sense but it's
expanding beyond that and as more and

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:25.090
more people I'm just going to change the
subject here as more and more people

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:36.870
come on the market can grow yes I'm
gonna grow so you know I think you know

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:43.859
with your courses I would you know what
I would do well is why I wouldn't

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:49.450
necessarily in your instance create a
free course at the beginning to think

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.190
you've already got the audience I think
I would get strikes up a course yeah and

00:03:54.190 --> 00:04:00.220
you know then you can you continue to
upsell you know the courses as you

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.000
create but I think what you said earlier
the way you said how to treat migraines

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:14.549
that's the course yeah yeah you know
deal with this health issue have to deal

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:21.400
with the health issue how to get my
whole thing is simple and easy in fact

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:29.669
make things simple thing I get people to
wear and it's very straightforward so

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:37.410
that's my whole expertise to simplifying
things for people taking taking the

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:46.370
complication out of people get very
confused and they're usually in many

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:54.590
ways so I have to do a lot of people
like taking them from maybe 19 senate

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:02.880
like meditation the only way surgery is
the only way to quickly understand that

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:10.220
this this other way is what we works now
I think everything is well known as

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.919
you've got an opportunity right now so
only one each

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:19.440
yeah and that's that's the thing with
you to make a potential to own in each

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:31.289
if you buy first-to-market some extent
so maybe there's not a competition if

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:35.570
there isn't I i dont worry about that
particular let my antiques cause is not

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:44.699
my best seller I put on there and it's
regularly because you know you know and

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:53.010
then she call on you to me that's very
niche business but it still sells so but

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:57.970
there is the reason people are doing
very well with health and fitness center

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:04.169

marketing

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:46.890
Dry Creek content found it really
difficult compete in such because of the

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:52.810
competition piece of content that
education marketing is extremely

00:07:52.810 --> 00:08:01.300
powerful because people if you can
educate people for free they will buy
