00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.920
so what percentage of keep all it do you
know that in time he could be learning

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:19.890
no I don't want very much I guess I'm
probably gaining I think the last month

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.480
by tree refunds totaling about $12 lost
revenue to me

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.480
yeah yeah anyway

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.920
information while of wax and wane here

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.469
shipping costs and all that

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:45.960
lost anything it's just I think what is
it great people that there are people

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.579
out there maybe just taken the course
and get the money back that's what I

00:00:50.579 --> 00:01:00.550
would imagine that I don't think people
are out to take advantage of the

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:09.150
majority of course they're genuine the
you know they don't wanna be the one

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:23.580
thing you know you have a migraine and
you solve that problem for them

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.090
appreciate it appreciate that you know
this is you know my wife philomena

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:37.850
different I was talking to a friend of
ours and he he was he was he this

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:44.420
company and they create this device that
you put in your mouth and it stops your

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:52.399
husband's snoring the basic principle
and they made the move to the back of

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:58.290
your first the diaphragm then doesn't
grow in the mountains of snow so you

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:07.110
know that my wife she's like wow how
much he said

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:21.800
child $1 helms $3,250 yeah so I and
she's like I'm so i cant say thats you

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.080
know I've got to agree to that of course
but I'm not sure I want something else

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:32.380
as I'm sleeping at night time but the
point was the point is you know that

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.730
problem if if if you could if you could
solve that problem by nineteen it

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:49.050
doesn't matter to me why I get that $10
$50

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:59.330
I'd like to know what did you really buy
a gun and apparently dis ones like you

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:08.260
know fitted and it's met it's not you
don't know check check it out because

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:21.410
I'm sure there'll be some Chinese seles
yeah yeah she put it in my already sleep

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:29.780
she thinks if she could she would
definitely but the point is you know

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.890
what was interesting was i'm saying
they're looking at you know and he says

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:43.970
15 budget didn't even blink and eyes
she's like you know you know the end of

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.500
the day you know I can't sleep properly
if you keep waking you up to tell me I'm

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:55.430
small very insensitive about you know so
that's my complain

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.930
yes but the point is that when people
you know have a need and you meet the

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:07.030
refund is no because they just can be so
happy

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:15.569
$19 sellers with integrity so if you're
showing integrity when you sell a

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.799
product I think this will give you all
the money back

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:24.490
back if you don't like it I mean that
alone and warms up to you I think

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:30.819
anything just for my money back

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:41.240
yeah yeah yeah I think funnel is is
having that risk reversal yeah just

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:47.069
before top tip for people here always
place the risk reversal just before you

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:48.229
ask for the sale

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:54.990
yeah it's the last piece of the jigsaw
so you coming to funnel they know

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.620
everything there comes a point

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.210
places decision news I look to take a
risk I'm going to take the risk

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:09.509
yeah let's do this trade just tried you
money and that really helps you know

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:23.319
people take that extra step to go pick
up my yeah I'm going to wrap up now

yeah I just say get on with it now I'll
get out there get started start with a

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:14.120
minimum viable product just to figure
out what you need to do in the

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:20.840
marketplace don't try your best seller
know yeah you know that'd be fun to be

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:29.710
on camera little bit you know I will be
I made a video I did you know I needed

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.030
20 videos I just want them to look a
little more

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:36.460
so I know I'm gonna work or not

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:43.390
yeah yeah it's you'd be surprised what
you can do have a look at some point of

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:48.110
green screen but a friend of mine we you
know I'll also put a link to the only

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:54.040
community in the side now the OV
community is a community I run for you

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:59.460
structures where we collaborate and help
each other and one of my friends are you

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:07.570
fully she she started a few months back
recourse to pee is back and she just

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:17.650
moved to green screen where she started
to see how professional looks now about

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:24.920
a few skills you recommend agreed not at
the beginning not be going to be

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:29.600
technically what is it beginning you
learning so much talking heads which is

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.720
what we're talking about here talking
heads

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:37.280
that's the most technically challenging
stuff still and the reason being is you

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:41.380
gotta lie sound sound gets really
difficult talking heads when you're

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:46.660
doing a screencast and you can use a
decent my and its next your mouth closer

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:51.930
to mike is about the sound is an autopsy
to place but when you talk to move to

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:59.690
Michael why this challenging the first
thing is just to get used to cram course

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:06.360
and then start doing the most moving
along and creating the better product

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:11.860
growing into a product you know every
course I create I want to improve on the

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:15.660
last time you just learn as you go along
and that's the best way to approach

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:20.840
rather than trying to go straight in a
really strong talking heads unless you

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:35.120
come from the best marketing meeting and
I'm sure we'll catch up against a thank

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:35.830
you very much

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:38.630
ok guys I'm going to switch off now
thank you for watching
