00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.590
over really quickly 'cause diego's XPS
question a couple times we haven't

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.480
answered it we're running out of time
here we're gonna have to wrap it up

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:13.780
Diego asked about the top things that
influenced the ranking of your course

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.460
that's that's subject to speculation by
a lot of people there are number of

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.560
courses he actually has a course on the
building that I'd like to to say about

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.510
that comment is what we're really
talking about here is how your your own

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.040
in your own marketing in the advantage
of being able to do that thing is that

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.000
you aren't going to be as heavily
affected by how you to meet them in

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.030
where you appear in their results mark
give you the hint about the way that you

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.890
can circumvent this whole what affects
the ranking of your YouTube and how many

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.170
of you remember what it was he said

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.020
create a recourse that the good course
that's on that popular topic because

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.949
that's the way to do it doesn't really
matter where you see you in an

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.829
interesting things lately when they're
showing the different categories of

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.430
people get upset about it for a while I
don't remember but they were actually

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.590
putting the popular courses in the
subject so that's one thing that you do

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:21.159
to help you get around this whole how do
I get myself to regain your exact

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.220
science in honestly they just had a bug
the other day that when you updated your

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.900
quarters which is what you're supposed
to be doing your courses it actually

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:38.680
gave you negative points in one of my
top so so what ya what we're talking

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.579
about here

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:44.399
ways that you can kind of build you
could use a platform to build the

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.939
residual income for years without
necessarily being totally dependent

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:56.009
Diego I hope they gave you a decent
enough answer to that is far as I still

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:08.910
really wanna know we'll get one maybe
we'll get a little bit

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:17.320
you know I know there's like most things
I know it's not in this course and I

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:26.650
don't share that but yeah but you want
to say market people want to hang around

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.730
afterwards and continues I'm good so you
know once we finish this section you

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:53.710
know if you even if you need to hang
around you know well and I'm never ever

00:02:53.710 --> 00:03:22.780
ever people are masters at right now but
I need sound like a training course in

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:36.050
them because you know digital trying to
coerce property I believe you know if

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:41.150
you've got a natural audience already
training course is just incredible

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:50.989
because you no one is gonna get people
really you know we cannot sell your you

00:03:50.989 --> 00:04:03.380
know so that's where I would really sore
focus and concentrate agreed that's what

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.090
I've always done anyway

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:14.390
coats and I i think the best thing in
the world

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.920
selling information and education

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:29.690
I love him and that's what it's all
about so yeah it's about providing you

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:35.420
know that's one of the things I mean yes
I will share my story with money on

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.340
books and reading of making money
wherever people want it because I would

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.380
spend money on books because what I most
people online and then go online and try

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:54.860
and land and try to look on free content
but the knowledge is in the books and

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.400
that's the knowledge is in the paint
courses so yeah you gonna get lot of

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.910
free stuff and it's going to be you know
but the real knowledge is gonna be given

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:08.180
when people pay for the course and
that's when it's the people that realize

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:15.220
that again especially when it comes to
developing businesses and stuff

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:21.550
self doin it for twelve years now
different businesses get into the place

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.500
where and i seven run a business we
haven't done it before you know I

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:33.110
remember those books on Japanese
porcelain and you just didn't even know

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:42.090
one day I collected a good reference on
Japanese porcelain tile of these books

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.490
was the shit bata collection

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.270
Japanese books Japanese

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:55.820
you never gonna find the information
about 500 pounds I made that back into

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:02.310
auctions you know and that's why people
going best people to understand that

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.130
people do understand that hungry to
learn and his most amazing thing about

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:20.330
online a great second education
education

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:25.030
the middle class all of a sudden access
education and everything changed

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.210
everything

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:32.680
what we've got now is we are in the
second grade education is because all

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:40.300
you need to access education is now I've
got friends who live in Africa and you

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:49.539
know they've never run a cable 208 in
the middle of them via but what's

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:57.289
bringing the country's major cities
straight tomorrow both 3G 4G straight

00:06:57.289 --> 00:07:03.729
not now means that even people in remote
places now have access to education and

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:14.060
why is it that most people want to learn
how to make money that they want to make

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:18.800
money on health care wanna you know they
gonna be simple things but the whole

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:24.569
world is opening up the market because
of the mobile revolution that the right

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:31.199
place is machinima causes of himself
between 10 and $19 and that's really you

00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:37.360
know destructive in the marketplace
because most people use but this is a

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:43.870
one to many modern metal prices collapse
in and people are $7,000 courses gonna

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:51.479
realize because unless you are really
strong following 500,000 when you can go

00:07:51.479 --> 00:08:01.050
on YouTube all this stuff going on it's
really exciting this is great education

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:07.990
and we're sitting in the middle of it
and that's why you about it so one point

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:11.629
that I wanna meet here because this
marks that earlier so he just said

00:08:11.629 --> 00:08:15.779
something in passing about this whole
education that's going on about how you

00:08:15.779 --> 00:08:18.819
gotta figure that your chris is gonna be
sold for ten to nineteen dollars buys

00:08:18.819 --> 00:08:21.650
directly back to earlier in what he had

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:30.830
mentioned earlier was about first of all
with the stock photography in how then

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:38.839
everybody was coming in and what it's
going to take to make money and then

00:08:38.839 --> 00:08:41.810
another thing that he had mentioned was
the idea about looking at software and

00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:46.810
applications in how the price of
software applications has come down with

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:50.560
the whole extra type thing when you look
at stuff like especially with Amazon in

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:57.830
the books on Amazon $0.99 to buy
something on iTunes $0.99 in this exact

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:02.010
same thing that marketing right now to
look at what's happening with education

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:08.709
is dead people are recognized hey I can
get a decent digital product a decent

00:09:08.709 --> 00:09:13.110
course here in the range of 10 to 19
dollars in this is important to keep in

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:17.770
mind because there are so many
discussions that still happen and you

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:21.650
know me studio still have been in you to
me that people will get on in the

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:26.860
growing about the fact like I do this
training offline in its I tried to

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:31.900
$2,000 to do this seminar why am I gonna
come in to YouTube and sell it for $10

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.709
that doesn't make any sense

00:09:33.709 --> 00:09:38.910
well it's just a different mindset you
cannot approach in this comes down to

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:43.400
these things that Mark has been talking
about today it's going to be a numbers

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:49.700
game is a volume about the residual
income is a digital products in when

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:53.300
you've got the proper type of finals in
place you got the proper type of mindset

00:09:53.300 --> 00:10:00.490
and you understand how to approach you
to me as a business it's not that I'm

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:07.279
creating a course on you I'm building a
business in to help you understand they

00:10:07.279 --> 00:10:12.430
did not get so worked up about Lake Ohau
dollars in nineteen dollars of course

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:20.110
well I never so you know these things
are very important to keep in mind when

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:23.200
you're approaching this in also for
those of you who are not on you to be a

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:27.930
lot of things that we're talking about
equally well you

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:33.200
online business that you're gonna run in
and even still for those of you are

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.220
dealing with traditional products or
services in brick-and-mortar there's a

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:40.339
whole lot that you can take away from
this in recognizing the idea of what she

00:10:40.339 --> 00:10:44.820
needs with your marketing finals year so
