00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
the other side of it is you gotta look
at the other digital businesses very

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.240
similar to you to me although it doesn't
appear so in the third since I'm not was

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.799
that is stock photography stock
photography is selling digital product

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.460
online and there was something happened
in the marketplace there was a price

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.880
point never arrived at and if you look
at that you can't predict what's gonna

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.939
happen with online education and you can
see what's gonna happen you gotta rinse

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:37.370
apps you've got you know you I think
about absolute absolute 234 pounds you

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.629
know remember when software used to be
minimum 20 25 30 there's there's a

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.160
destructive element comes into the
marketplace and so these are some of the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.760
things you got me thinking that you're
looking at the shoot me business

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.530
starting to understand it because you
know it's disrupting me online

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.449
educational markets exile bringing the
price point death but it's also now

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:07.180
rolling out to the masses and that's
what happened in stock so what do you do

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.100
with it then so like you said you your
key to making money in the antique

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.100
scorers is that you invested lots of
money in educating yourself which had

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.710
appointment that you are buying books
there was no you to be there to take you

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.479
to be courses on Chinese so you studied
all these things you learned all about

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.549
the antique so you got a niche market
that you're doing you said you have to

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.960
look at things like the fact that
there's these disruptive elements not

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.030
recognizing the price look what happened
in the things went with people being

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.630
able to sell the stock photos look what
happened with the software now in the

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.310
pricing so what have you done with all
that information gathered through

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.710
educating yourself to me and looking at
these other types you know opportunities

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.110
for people were

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.410
running online businesses how have you
taken all information and put it

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:08.350
together to make me stop industry that
was really interested in anyone that

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.000
wants to watch what happened

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.930
anyone with a digital picture frame and
sell it and then what happened after

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.340
time with the images bill bill bill and
then the stock photography by raising

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:31.080
the standards and stars actually we
don't want this general stuff anymore so

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.020
you gotta get better and that was one
factor just one side or the other side

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.070
of it was the people that we talked
about this business

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:49.860
create the stock so they would be a
massive studio and in this studio you

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.959
know by the time a nice dinner million
dollars just on a stock photography

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.190
they would do is they would see which
images really selling well grounded

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:09.840
image and I would do so what their house
and he would have a kitchen in a setting

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.380
living room setting and so anytime an
office setting anytime you need to a

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.890
particular just got that they were
chanting and the point here is they were

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:28.850
running it like a manufacturing facility
so long term it was the guys that were

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:38.280
high quality content fast and they would
need for finding clusters are refined in

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.560
particular areas that were making money
so once you start seeing and

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.640
understanding when you start crying
courses you've actually got the switch

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.910
yet to switch from I'm gonna create
cause I think people will like to I'm

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.660
gonna create courses at the market ones
and they're two different things and

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.870
that's a big big switch when you realize
then your courses can start to make

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:11.830
money because now you're actually
delivering to market and then tell the

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:17.989
people have their ties into this idea of
creating high-quality content there how

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.890
do you the big costs in you to me

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:31.960
course creation that the biggest causes
time so I'm right now I'm so people can

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:40.440
see it so I MUST ok so purpose bill
studio green screen I'm set up what that

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:50.010
means is this I can walk in the stuff I
decided to do a course a three-course

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.160
from start to finish I think it took me
three days

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.950
courses about two and a half hours long
from start to finish now a new subject

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.599
really well so I wasn't researching you
get me but i sat down for this new free

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:08.260
course it to me three days why because
I'm gonna shoot your setup I got my

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:14.000
systems in place this is a business and
manufacturing business manufacturing

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:23.280
digital content that's one part as a
mental flip if you want to succeed on

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.830
you but that's one side of it is you
gotta make sure you've got production

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:33.099
capability in place you know me mess
around with sound you don't be sorry

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:39.750
record you don't want to go out your
whole system I filmed live live greens

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.270
slides everything is designed to get the
time down deliver the highest quality

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.280
possible in the shortest amount of time

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:58.120
ok but if you're seeing here if you paid
attention so Mark said just the other

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.320
day he mentioned so he's got a studio
setup so that he can get in here and he

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.150
can start filming right away he's got
stuff that he knows who you have to

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.539
spend a lot of time researching it and
he's ready to produce the course he's

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:11.529
got the course done in three days time

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:17.129
but how many of you paid attention to
the fact that he said he produced a

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:33.789
three course thing is your business
business you have to build a business to

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:39.559
business now you know that's not gained
building platform of parties we can talk

00:06:39.559 --> 00:06:47.009
about exit strategies but this is a
platform that has the people that you

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:52.949
can let me give you a quick example I'm
released this new free course upon you

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:58.839
and I've got following and UJ back to
engage in discourse subject and two

00:06:58.839 --> 00:07:04.399
weeks ago and I've add 1,250 views on
the twelve lectures

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:09.989
same course on YouTube in two weeks
about 1,500

00:07:09.989 --> 00:07:19.249
running a successful business online is
this is a really simple principle you

00:07:19.249 --> 00:07:25.689
are a marketing company sells digital
product you are marketing company that

00:07:25.689 --> 00:07:33.860
sells training in this classic example
of this is Red Bull no I'm not

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:38.239
products I think so terrible product
people taking a much caffeine alone I'm

00:07:38.239 --> 00:07:42.999
sure you'll agree on this very healthy
person but because she knows levels of

00:07:42.999 --> 00:07:48.769
caffeine that Red Bull when you ask
people what the Red Bull do people say

00:07:48.769 --> 00:07:55.499
oh Red Bull makes easy drinks and that's
not what Red Bull Red Bull our marketing

00:07:55.499 --> 00:08:02.439
company itself is it reeks and if you
want everything I do consider how good

00:08:02.439 --> 00:08:07.559
how far it goes there are marked in
company sells fizzy drinks so when you

00:08:07.559 --> 00:08:11.069
wanna be a success to me really
important to understand this you need to

00:08:11.069 --> 00:08:19.209
be a marketing company to solve a
specific subject and now and what most

00:08:19.209 --> 00:08:22.860
people when they run a business they
concentrate on the

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:28.810
develop a product and they won't develop
the market but the most successful

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:32.450
businesses are ones that are best
marketing look at Apple look at the

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:44.279
iPhone ok what is Steve Jobs to combine
them credit people think the guy

00:08:44.279 --> 00:08:49.269
invented iPhones he didn't hit a couple
of concepts are already working and he

00:08:49.269 --> 00:08:55.890
marketed product but it wasn't bad
original you know if you know the

00:08:55.890 --> 00:09:01.370
history of the devices you know
smartphones one not something that I

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:05.880
find invented it was it was a natural
progression in the marketplace they just

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:15.050
did it better and that's the difference
thank you get some people cause

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:18.959
everybody and you to me want how to
program you know this programming

00:09:18.959 --> 00:09:19.970
language

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:25.500
twenty thousand pound in two months
that's because of high demand product

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:29.160
but everybody else

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:35.300
immortals we have to market a product
and that's where people go wrong because

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:38.190
they don't prioritize the Moxie business
