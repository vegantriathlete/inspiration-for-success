00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.720
not so yeah and how much water for now I
think her course is $39 and I think what

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.440
she did with her early launched his
confirmation list I think she sold it

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:22.699
$19 apiece so busy she done a good job
of building an audience over time

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:27.150
scientists razor who's in the side by
side you know they're done the marketing

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.150
up front they built the audience I miss
you and then when they launched to have

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:37.750
a captive audience and hit his smell
smoke that really really interesting now

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.329
some was asking about you to me
algorithm works but I just explain one

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.620
thing that the how it really works if
you if you release of course into the

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:55.550
marketplace and you develop 50,000 1500
2000 whatever dollars ourselves at

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.360
launch

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.039
you to me don't come out all courses
equally if I see your cause

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.330
going into the marketplace making money
this is what I do we want a piece of

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.659
that pie because they spend money
advertising people's courses and they

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.110
don't advertise equally so when they see
a course coming in and people misses you

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.110
need an external marketing funnel

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:27.530
algorithm you need to create some sales
so if you go in and you create sales the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.420
ranking for your call now if you get
your course above the fold in your cats

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.170
are grey or under your key would that's
when the big money comes you know we've

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:46.030
got people doing 10 15 20 30 40 50
thousand dollars a month just by being

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:52.479
so if you get caught in the top of the
file you go and that and you know you

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.920
have to optimize it well as some things
you have to do but the main thing and

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.640
this is what people miss the main thing
is actually get the sales in the first

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.869
place to get a thousand the first by
some people on the platform looking you

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.250
to me said they grabbed it and that
promote like crazy because

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.390
they're not going to spend all their
advertising money on causes it done

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:18.100
cells if you give them a call that sells
they're open to you that because I'm in

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:35.840
the IITs me behind a reverse known that
we not really like you know I like I

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:47.860
usually do I get my member Mr Burley
works and I have fun tonight so now if I

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:57.950
was like not do you like that you think
drives like the health sector you to me

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.040
is quite good but they tend to be a
little bit broader I don't think the

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:08.340
question why do you need to worry about
it and in fact why was this when you

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.880
create courses on you to me we'll come
back to class this now so I've got this

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.810
is a mistake people make is well they
create the cost one door closes on

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.570
Photoshop for instance will of course is
to end of course to end all courses on

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.330
photography now

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:28.280
top-selling courses by Guy Fawkes 11 and
it's a complete guide to talk he does

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.530
pretty well so that people have got the
course not doing as well

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.910
video production is any been so we now
have a look at it when your trying to

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:47.989
compete on one subject in one needs with
one cause it's really tough so I the

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.769
best interests Craig classes of courses
was talking about this site for instance

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:57.459
I've got full classes I teach in which
is business marketing course creation

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:03.440
and photography I draw my background in
my photography cluster for instance just

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:11.900
see this was a course on how to use a
DSLR camera like a process man how to

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.370
use manual mode on a DSLR US one course
that's a basic calls people come in and

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.140
wanna learn how to use a sniff at CBS I
like a pro

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.620
we're going to teach

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.290
that's one calls then their creative
photography course where you can take

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.680
this course and I'll show you how to do
creative teaching composition lighting

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.919
photography and you can use an iPhone so
that's a different group of people come

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:38.729
in and if you have an iPhone take their
course and take great pictures are gone

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:43.250
of course which is portrayed studio
photography classical styles we teach

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:48.190
split lighting all the classic style
rembrandt we teach all of that i'm gonna

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.540
advanced studio licensed of course which
teaches all the popular modern lighting

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:58.350
styles and they're gone of course that's
how to set a home-based studio and run a

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:04.330
business from home as photographer now I
can create one course but by creating

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.860
all those different courses to things
happen I target people live Nation

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.070
trousseau point in time they can go on
and by the courses and the other thing

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:22.910
is I'm now competing in you to be such
under five times on Google by the way

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:29.120
not to get too far off like into another
whole set of topics we can talk about

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.400
but another thing that mark was when you
got these multiple courses you to me now

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:41.370
actually in this is glad they doing this
your course descriptions didn't used to

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.419
appear anywhere except for taking the
courses they clicked in this area

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:51.010
finally got the idea make your course
descriptions part of the HTML markup

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.539
that's on the page on your landing page
which means that Google search engines

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:59.180
will see the text in there and what you
can do is to make sure that you in your

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.400
course descriptions you've got some good
keywords in there that people likely to

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.500
be searching on it so to marks in the
cluster of courses if you got one course

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:15.289
ok what have you done many lectures in
there but you can't just like you have

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:20.840
to be suitable to that lecture right for
each description keywords with you got a

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:28.240
cluster forces you got that opportunity
to have that keyword used across

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:38.039
those courses which can help finding you
when they are searching google with that

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:49.240
last bit I gotta bail because I've got
to head off to another meeting here to

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:54.690
join us here in a while if you guys want
your conversations mark will decide when

00:06:54.690 --> 00:07:03.210
he's gonna call it quits here I will
make sure that the replay the link that

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:08.050
I put in there actually I guess actually
takes you to the courses section of my

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:12.360
website that's fine it's the same domain
there will have to replay all have the

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:18.250
various links here to get a transcript
but I'm still working on my process

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:24.889
there so we'll have all that stuff
available for you and I wish you a great

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:37.729
