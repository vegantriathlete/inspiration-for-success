you know it's like if I just copy what
they're gonna be successful

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:12.519
not realizing that that is not
necessarily you know they're not often

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:14.960
having the full picture

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:23.140
yes I you know it's it's about you know
is just coming back to that is a

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:29.810
business and seeing this is early days
and that's really exciting because if

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.700
you get into something like this on the
ground floor this is ground floor time

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:39.820
this is a time to get in get you courses
out this is ground water now until three

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.620
years when anyone else is trying to get
in this happened in stock photography

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.129
remember said about coming into stock
photography what's happening now is

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.100
commercial photographers have trouble
getting the truck was approved these are

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.600
the guys who make their living because
the market is locked down now because

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.000
I've got enough of certain types of
content and that's gonna happen to you

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.480
to get in now

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.280
london Business be prepared not to make
money for the first 12 months and we

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.270
think about how we're going to target is
how am I gonna keep going and not make

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.760
money from this twelve months

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.130
residual income and we say it's 12 to 18
months and that we hope are you sure

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.540
people will make money straight away but
for a lot of people it's a grind grind

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:30.579
out out most good businesses alike and
that's what you have to do

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:36.270
thanks for taking a seat that people
come in with your questions I checked

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:45.579
out your words I've been on there myself
I'm thinking about creating more sense

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:52.600
for what I do but I've never seen the
little daunting to be honest even though

00:01:52.600 --> 00:02:01.270
I'm created online shoppers that's all
I've done so actually having to go in

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.479
and create video content and which I
would have imagined is probably the most

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.340
effective way to set up a worse now

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.840
to ask you what does have you ever done
any courses without doing video and just

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:24.450
the information produced content without
video business powerful it doesn't get

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.060
the engagements of your Kindle of
engagement with non video courses time

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:37.640
that by ten yeah that's what I would
imagine how to sell so is like the damn

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.310
do people know how many people now you
know when invoked the book jurassic

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:54.030
world right by worried about about
actually I was first came out I bought

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.879
the book is amazing I was the only
person in the cinema actually

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.970
disappointed in the film you know
because I brought a book and there's a

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.290
lot more dinosaurs in the book and they
put in this bill that's going back a bit

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.980
changed a bit but the point is that's
that's what people are consuming yeah

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:17.040
because we have to that's where we we
have to have and to be honest is not as

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.799
daunting as you might think it's just a
case of learning some scale is just you

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:28.430
know developing certain skills so you
can place yourself in the marketplace

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.120

money in this from $9 office group size
if you're interested

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:22.790
yes I how does that some ways it you
struggle wave lol no well yes Noel Noel

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:31.310
particularly usually to be one thing
making the video is it being on camera

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:47.570
and I like where you know a woman I
think it's a little different so much

00:04:47.570 --> 00:05:02.030
more baby what you wear it makes you
look back it's not it's really easy to

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:07.970
solve you first course for a first
course you don't have to appear on

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.810
camera so you can do a slide show what
we call us

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.800
screencast and audio and just presented
that way now what we would recommend as

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:23.690
you maybe have the promo video and the
introduction of a little video segment

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:30.419
at the beginning of each slide show that
you don't have to appear on camera but

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:33.610
is it a good ideas actually appear on
camera

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.520
the reason being it creates connection
with students we just don't have to do a

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.240
lot of it because once they see new ones
in now he looked like another hearing

00:05:43.240 --> 00:06:01.449
your voice so you have a few hours are
you are you doing this video

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:20.360
22 in pictures and video production
company and I'm used to be an on-camera

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.270
lying I'm quite happy love my new free
courses nearly constantly me on screen

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:30.599
talking and I don't have an issue but
recently with all of my courses I'm

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:33.309
actually pull back on that and not
because I have a problem because I know

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:36.889
my students don't necessarily want to
watch me for the whole three and a half

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:41.439
hours longer cost orkut they're happy to
see slides and it's also been engaged

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:43.460
about breaking the students attention

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:50.180
yeah you want to switch around a bit
surprised them and that spot engagement

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:55.960
as well so you know you don't need to do
that with you first course I would say

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:00.809
and then he's ever seen you can do crazy
first course do all slideshow get into

00:07:00.809 --> 00:07:01.689
the marketplace

00:07:01.689 --> 00:07:06.479
quick simple introductory course you can
learn how to crack or so new to me and

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:10.180
later on you can always go back and
change electoral to a prime I we've you

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:15.800
talkin ok but the important thing is to
get caught up there and go through that

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:24.990
process because you is a huge learning
curve 20 minutes he you are right it is

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:28.789
adopting test it's a humongous learning
curve markedly different type of the

00:07:28.789 --> 00:07:34.499
learning curve because he did already
have the background in photography and

00:07:34.499 --> 00:07:37.569
video we don't really have time to get
into some of the other learning curve

00:07:37.569 --> 00:07:43.199
that market we all have some learning
curve so just know it's gonna be it's

00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:53.069
gonna be hard make the courses short as
you can make their can you make thirty

00:07:53.069 --> 00:07:56.080
minutes 30 minutes minimum

00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:00.069
least 30 minutes of content sixty
percent of which has to be video which

00:08:00.069 --> 00:08:03.719
means I did put a note in your deal can
just be a voiceover on a slideshow

00:08:03.719 --> 00:08:07.409
budget that at least 18 minutes of video
content

00:08:07.409 --> 00:08:10.519
you have to have at least five lectures
you have to have at least 30 minutes

00:08:10.519 --> 00:08:17.330
content and it did the key thing is to
make sure that you do get that first

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:21.369
created it's a huge learning curve but
it's a huge sense of accomplishment when

00:08:21.369 --> 00:08:27.669
you submit a review and probably it's
gonna have required fixes that you just

00:08:27.669 --> 00:08:31.629
don't stress about it you make sure to
go through their test video process

00:08:31.629 --> 00:08:33.930
those that you can get whacked over and
over again

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:46.139
alright so that your course to do you
need a total of thirty minutes of

00:08:46.139 --> 00:08:50.269
content you need a minimum of five
lectures in your course and you need a

00:08:50.269 --> 00:09:06.529
minimum of 80 90 minutes of video is
nothing hour and a half hour and a half

00:09:06.529 --> 00:09:18.899
by Thomas issues when you get close so I
just in the process of you go following

00:09:18.899 --> 00:09:33.380
you have artists I do I have been doing
yesterday you are so all of it yeah yeah

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:38.339
you're gonna be one of those people who
when you live your first course in you

00:09:38.339 --> 00:09:41.589
like you send out the email and like
what you want to do it you kind of want

00:09:41.589 --> 00:09:46.870
to get on the early bird subscriber you
do this you'll be one of those people at

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:53.430
you like you're like oh my god in the
first 24 hours I made 1500 bucks so you

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:54.800
can be said that I wanted
