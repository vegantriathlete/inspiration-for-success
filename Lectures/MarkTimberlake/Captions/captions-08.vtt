calls out that cannot last lecture you

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:21.319
become the source of traffic as well and
just point because in fact we've got a

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:31.050
message that's right in this dream right
now from Bryn who got numbers I just

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:39.080
lost my first eighteen customers but
already turned one turn to a real client

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.110
so to bring his used as we're talking
about these tunnels putting the final

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.200
together bridges using you to me also
has a funnel

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:55.730
getting her you know one-on-one flying
and when you understand the power of

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:06.599
this is like I said earlier I put one on
and on you to me I think made sure what

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.349
it was two hundred hit toon appear to
have something like that

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:30.310
12 combined in the same period on you to
me I picked up fifteen hundred and and I

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:51.950
like what you were saying about how you
know I know this he believed you that I

00:03:51.950 --> 00:04:10.709
have won anyway that's it pays off in
the end when you have a writing and it's

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:17.459
just in the marketplace that I actually
think the online pricing what what I as

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.769
I'm you to be a telling us the price
point

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.680
online Chinese tend to $19

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:30.169
because you do all the time between ten
and $19 all the time and you know

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:35.560
they've got more diet whenever anybody
else not standing that's an

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:43.410
anti-business an item is only worth what
someone is willing to pay ya know if

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:57.380
that's what they're willing to pay
that's what this is and yeah yeah that's

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:04.160
that's the way you know it was people
are only willing to pay an amount I

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:13.150
never think of it this I'm selling I am
selling little bit of life when you

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:27.130
really but I think I'm right and not
essentially I'm selling over and over

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:36.190
again and this is why I honestly believe
changing time for money is a form of

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.620
slavery

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.260
strong statement because they have to
pay you lessen the world to make a

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:48.190
profit from talking about selling
services exchanging time for money in a

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:53.659
salary based its slavery you can only
ever sell your time you're selling your

00:05:53.659 --> 00:06:01.789
mind when you created product lucky you
are taking your time

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:09.590
time into digital content and then
you're saying that over and over and

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.740
over again and I think residual income
business models have never been easier

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:19.099
never been more exciting than it is
right now because in the past when you

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:27.580
want to buy houses you have to buy
something funny but now you don't you

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:33.740
just need to be willing to put some time
into digital product and then sell that

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:34.830
product

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:43.340
and if you're online and doing anything
I think it's a crime not to have in the

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:53.310
back end for people to buy homes sold I
wanted I wanted broke right now I'm not

00:06:53.310 --> 00:07:04.740
advocating I'm definitely going by the
way no well when its successful then you

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:12.170
have to make sure that you're one of my
guest created largest make a successful

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:19.440
and then come talk to me I will
definitely we try to make it but we have

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:31.360
been really helpful and really thinking
about going on I'm actually been

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:42.560
thinking this could be a great and you
know what we specialize in helping

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:50.230
people build and also I would side when
you build ada ok so the best way to

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:52.710
build a fun others like this

00:07:52.710 --> 00:08:00.470
builder product product yet the product
ready in the market place then you can

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:06.780
create desired content free content
which you've already got then interest

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:11.910
content which is your website already
got and then you put it on social media

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:18.350
see actually a well built a democracy
and I think so many people out there and

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:24.710
they're doing a damn about the product
is my product at the end they're doing

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:32.740
all this product at the end is nothing
beyond you know three thousand pounds

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:43.880
everything all complete you have no idea
I have the service I have every a

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:53.420
ethnic well then a beautiful website do
all the other projects lined up to work

00:08:53.420 --> 00:09:08.080
within my power keeps growing and then i
dont i dont have I'm just slow so far

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:17.670
away so many people like yourself going
to you to me and my sweat lodge

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:22.250
following already establish create not
cause cause I tell you something

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:33.540
your audience is gonna snap I know make
sure you tease them start marketing

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:39.420
course as you're building a tease them
give them hints about it you know give

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:42.200
them a little snippets about what you're
putting in the course buildup that

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:53.490
excitement yet there is a reason is that
our people and yet again nice living

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:59.120
teaching people how to make sour
actually I've done in a conversation

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:08.490
with their works well with your audience
you want to give them hit that there's

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:12.390
something coming you want to build the
anticipation because it may take you a

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:18.310
number of times for people to actually
sign up in the mailing list I don't know

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:27.350
what males I do so put together for the
early bird discount for your course when

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:30.970
it launches and I mean obviously you
know you're not going to be people over

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:38.410
the head with it but yeah but teach them
over time and get excited to get more

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:41.200
and more people to be on your mailing
list and then when you launch that

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:45.800
course you can tell its live in here is
the super amazing incredible discount

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:52.410
for use on a familiar with Jessica bars
in an interview just as well as

00:10:52.410 --> 00:11:00.529
that she teaches people how to make
jewelry when she launched her course she

00:11:00.529 --> 00:11:06.690
said what you plan to do that they want
it was lodged I forget what you mention

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:09.779
to these other things that have been
sitting on the back burner when she lost

00:11:09.779 --> 00:11:13.720
that day she said she spent the entire
day sitting in front of her computer

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:19.120
refreshing her income report on you
seeing how much he had made in sales you

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:26.220
did get anything done that and I think
she did you in 24 hours

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:26.819
course
