he's got a lot of experience with
aspects of the sales to the sales funnel

that you may not have considered that
will give us a chance to talk about

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.510
but before we get into the specifics of
the sales funnel I do want to give you

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.470
the chance to learn a little bit about
Mark's background that's something that

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.950
I think is valuable information and
background he's got a ton to talk about

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.500
so we'll give you a little bit of a
taste of some of the things in Mark we

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.000
mentioned that you got experience
selling mine products you tell us a

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.380
little bit about some of the things that
you've sold online previously prior to

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:34.240
coming to you to be self my wife and I
mean we run a business on eBay and we

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:42.930
was one of the largest exporter in the
UK and he could collect we're on that

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:52.250
business 12 years sign that was really
where we remember fallen in love with

00:04:52.250 --> 00:05:01.349
the idea of an online business that many
people doing it back then and you know

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:06.449
selling product back then was really
tough because people see product on the

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:11.840
internet so I hope business we didn't
have a shopper whole business was was

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:22.770
online selling a lot to you americans
you like and the Chinese Chinese

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.630
particularly like to buy from
chinese-american market all of us out

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:33.550
but it was really it was really good
time it was a really good time and

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:39.930
something we really enjoy dinner still
gotta love for antique porcelain and

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.570
Chinese ports and Japanese if you got
any other pieces of Chinese or Japanese

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:49.060
porcelain or strength thinks and you
wanna know what it is and he just just

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:54.990
ping me trust me so that was that was
where we came from that was

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:01.290
one basically had to do it while one
business and one day I'm watching

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:09.190
bargain so I said not knowing anything
about the trade and a really important

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.230
point to understand is gonna come into
the conversation later I made a lot of

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:15.250
business

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:22.560
ok I don't even talk about breaking even
here i'm talking and lost an important

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.980
point come back later on

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:31.100
yep you didn't bring up their baghdad
actually your antique business was at a

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.690
loss because this is part of the
important learning that you had up how

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:40.230
to do things right I was in so that this
was a smash success rate for the

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:46.810
beginning in there with ya as mark
mentioned humanity lost initially and so

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:50.850
other things so that I just want to tie
into a little bit of background so

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:55.800
you're doing these antiques which led
you to some other of your businesses as

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.290
well as a talk a little bit about some
of that we were selling some very

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:06.920
expensive and takes on line one of the
things we learned good quality because

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:14.800
it ended things from you know 25 pounds
1,500 pounds and we were selling them to

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.860
someone on the outside world and the
only thing I have to go without

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:25.170
description and we've been teased you
have to be really precise about all the

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:31.770
damage and everything's a tiny hairline
crack you've gotta show so what happened

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:35.360
was the MTG business started slowing
down during this this last recession

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:45.340
people were not buying antiques it was a
lot of our customers are middle-class so

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:52.640
that once they start feeling so I know
what we decided to do a commercial

00:07:52.640 --> 00:08:04.440
product and then we created a business
call business photography

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:27.860
I'm not let in and she said we should do
production and monies in video offering

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:37.669
video about five years and we tend to do
so high end commercial for medium-sized

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:39.849
companies and its own commercial
