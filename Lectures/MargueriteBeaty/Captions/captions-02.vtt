00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.060
get out yeah you're working on it you
now hit a little bit it some of the

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.610
things that you look at right now

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:18.289
did you feel are still things that you
would considers successes in worthwhile

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.369
for you coming to you to me so you
mentioned that you taking these classes

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.740
you're learning these new things to the
classes in your having to pick up all of

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.449
these marketing skills and that's one of
the things that we had talked about did

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:36.790
you use as a measure of the success that
you're having right now it's not so much

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.520
sure you're saying you'd love to be able
to support yourself full time you

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.239
presented your time with the income that
you make from you to me but there are

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.600
other things that you're looking at is
well some of which i think is that

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.590
you're learning so tell me a little bit
more about some of these other non

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.590
monetary things did you are looking at
that make you feel satisfied with the

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.699
progress you've made in with the things
that you're accomplishing right but not

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.090
the things that that I started learning
well first of all marketing open up a

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.640
whole new dorcas hadn't realized that I
really like that I always thought of

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.320
that it is sales right but I always
thought of it is just sales and I didn't

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.280
realize how creative you can get with
that because I kept having this big

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.310
words sales on top to know my head and I
couldn't get it out of the way and so

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.040
doing all these different courses i'm
looking at how different people look at

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.939
it and how they presented and how and
then how I will be able to do it and

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:46.270
I've been testing it out the thing is I
did a few other courses that say around

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.960
two workshops and everybody else tells
me to do this so that and you have to do

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.210
all this millions of things and that's
not really true and so when I see that I

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:02.880
can take a course at a time I can really
develop it or develop the skill or that

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.350
marketing area or something like that

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.509
I'm beginning to see that I don't have
to go crazy everywhere I can just focus

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.830
on one and make it really interesting
and right now so that's what I'm

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.640
focusing on right now we're a little bit
more on on trimming down all that

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.500
broadcasting but I was doing in I think
ahead in the count on every single thing

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:32.080
yeah you know I think the business of
photography and so that's the funniest

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.120
thing because I have stood as what
there's all this right at the beginning

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.489
of the class I asked my students who is
your customer and I get this from eighty

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.410
percent of my so that everyone is by
customers everyone that wants to buy a

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.780
photograph is my customer and you're
doing the same I'm going on

00:02:48.780 --> 00:03:00.840
oh well that's not quite as you are
being an instructor of photography

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:07.830
you're also being a student of business
and learning some new skills in in

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.799
getting to discover something that you
actually enjoy that you didn't realize

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:21.690
that you would enjoy and we also had
talked about the fact that it's not just

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:28.910
the money that you make directly from
YouTube P

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:35.540
debt contributes to the financial
success that we've had so what are some

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:41.370
of the other things that you have
actually had come your way on account of

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:48.420
the fact that you're able to leverage
you to me in a particularly it was about

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.530
my first class I did I think what
everyone or what I've been hearing

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.359
probably ninety percent of the teachers
who are new to me I did a very long and

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:03.000
very comprehensive class but I didn't do
it

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.329
thinking that it was going to be a
number one sales at all what happened

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:12.870
was I teach private classes and a lot of
people

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:19.090
they need background they need
assignments they need visuals and all

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:25.790
these things and i dont a pull-up or so
when I saw you did I thought whoa I

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:31.900
could use this as my platform this could
be my text books so I created a text

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:39.419
book for my classes so my first class is
not a good example but it's fantastic

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:45.530
from you because it's very comprehensive
and has a lot of information and so my

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.030
private students can go there and they
can do all the assignments and it's also

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.669
a review of what I teach them so it's
really my textbook and in that sense I

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:01.039
thought it was fun classic and then you
know prices for me and it's working out

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:03.220
very very nice

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:10.560
absolutely that you're using the class
as a resource that helps you with your

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:17.889
one-on-one doing for people and having
that resource enables you to experience

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:24.960
greater success with the one-on-one
teaching that you doing outside view to

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.900
me right now is it's not really so much
for that course is selling two through

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.800
unity organic and picking up all these
new students there is a tool that you're

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:42.949
able to use for clients who may be you
know days you worked with them

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:47.050
independently of you to me but having
you tammy has made that working

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:53.990
relationship better and it's it's been
really great because they can share it

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:58.449
as well it's been really helpful all
around and I do sell it to them

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:06.330
21 course with me let's say 11 private
one-on-one then instead of them doing

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.520
part number two with me they can do it
like that as well so can work both ways

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:17.780
you can works as sales of another class
or it can work just text book and so I

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:22.260
think it's you know we can do quite a
bit with this if we think moro you know

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.260
about the different possibilities right
and that's getting into

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:32.130
you how I had kind of pissed this the
people is about the idea of thinking of

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:37.100
the bigger picture and thinking of your
larger goals that you have just about

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:43.710
its not see there's anything wrong with
people setting up their goals and I

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:45.310
talked with Mark Timberlake

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.370
she said you have to understand you
approach you to me as a business in your

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:53.020
gonna make clusters of trances and you
need to be serious about this which is a

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.940
fine way to do things in a certainly the
way that that I'm doing things as well

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:02.750
and at the same time it's helpful to be
able to hear from other people like you

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:07.950
who are saying like well sure you know
that would be great for that said I mean

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:10.970
come but it doesn't have to be limited
to that that even if it doesn't I can

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:15.340
still utilize it in ways that help me
put the pieces together and it still

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.020
plays in soon

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:23.530
part of the larger picture did you have
for the things that you're doing are you

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:29.030
still doing any of the adjunct teaching
at this point know all the Art Institute

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:41.120
online but I'm not driving around doing
stuff strictly online in how are you an

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:47.680
integer experience is with doing stuff
online three universities doing stuff

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:53.710
online through the Art Institute thing
about you to me I don't have much

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:57.520
interaction with the students and they
aren't insisted I have been tracks

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:02.660
weekly interaction with them and I
really like that and I wish there was a

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:07.830
way to do this more with European am
sure there might be a wait maybe I can

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:12.550
think of a way of implementing it I
think that would be really awesome I

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:16.020
think it would be really awesome for the
students as well because I also have

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:21.180
many students asked me you know
assistant interactive classroom just let

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:25.750
you set up a nice tits videos but I'm
present all the time I make a point of

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:29.840
doing you know being present in the
class and posting tips and things like

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:33.089
that but it's not the same as always

00:08:33.089 --> 00:08:36.879
you know and it was all I need to think
about that I'm sure there may be a way

00:08:36.879 --> 00:08:41.680
of doing you know once a month the video
maybe a blog or something like that

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:46.269
another thinking of how to implement
that into the classes because I think

00:08:46.269 --> 00:08:50.879
that's going to make it a lot more
interest in the students have you done

00:08:50.879 --> 00:08:55.629
anything are considered anything like a
Facebook group to have as a supplement

00:08:55.629 --> 00:09:01.550
to the class I have thought about it and
no I haven't done it yet I have not seen

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:14.339
a group for Facebook and so that's
giving us an idea of the you know this

00:09:14.339 --> 00:09:19.389
side of the business here and having
your classes up new did your first class

00:09:19.389 --> 00:09:26.170
and as a comprehensive class said she
joined your group pictures of your bread

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:37.809
stories you wanna get better picture I
sent her class so the first course of

00:09:37.809 --> 00:09:42.990
this is of course that you're able to
use as your textbook in so is this big

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:48.220
horse so how did things go for you and
you are producing that first course it

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:56.610
was a total disaster because I
understand about still life I thought ok

00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:01.929
I know exactly how to play some life to
get a call from entry tonight on someone

00:10:01.929 --> 00:10:07.129
and I can do that very question I
thought my videos to light not right so

00:10:07.129 --> 00:10:14.059
I just put up some lights I went to I
did what everyone says I have strokes so

00:10:14.059 --> 00:10:18.929
obviously we can't film and strokes W
popping up the time of the night club or

00:10:18.929 --> 00:10:24.480
something so I just went to Home Depot
and I got one of these delights of very

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:31.839
fearful or I don't know whatever $10 or
less and I use one of my cum was which

00:10:31.839 --> 00:10:39.110
was a its shadow mirrorless camera that
had video and I said it up

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:45.450
and I started talking and it was hard
horrible like quality was terrible the

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:57.410
song the song was wonderful course and I
sent it to you to me like I started

00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:02.000
doing the investigation that everyone
and I started posting on you to me in

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.970
the studio you know help me like a whole
but I think that all the phone
