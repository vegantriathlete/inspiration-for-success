00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.620
the first person that helped me with
sound was Ian Robinson underachieved

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.210
chat with him hit the spot cut caught
costing classes and he helped me

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.009
tremendously he kind of put me in the
right you know and I still had to do a

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:20.240
lot of investigations that he put me in
the right direction for sound but

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.880
lighting I was still having a difficult
time so ok so I went to Home Depot and I

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.330
got one of these and then I got a
lifestyle while I had the lights done

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.380
but if if you were starting you would
have to get the lights that and then I

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:41.250
got one of my umbrellas but then to make
its ok I had to do a little simple so

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.789
that the umbrella will stay and then of
course I moved the umbrella fell delight

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:50.250
fellow everything it was the biggest
mess you could imagine and it took me

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.149
awhile to finally going to get one of
these this one over here this large red

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:00.870
light which is the Pedialyte and I gave
in and then in office I was thinking the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.769
amount of money that I would have spent
is already the amount of money that that

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.090
like costs so I went through all these
stupid things when I put a stent the

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:17.470
same $100 now I spent almost $200 yeah
and so that's when I started thinking

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.090
well I'm gonna do it class like this you
know to help people that are trying to

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.860
do that and that's the classic stuck
right now in limbo because I'm have to

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:34.560
you know I got a little I had to fix
things were quite how you did me once I

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.259
had that same experience starting now
that an idea even before I'd come to you

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.939
to be a happened to come across with the
end I saw their do it yourself lighting

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.439
kit and then you to me always references
people to the you do it yourself

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.939
lighting as well which maybe that's fine
we're starting Sept like you can see I

00:01:54.939 --> 00:02:00.740
shoot green screen trying to go with his
whiskey a do it yourself lighting kit

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.369
with the same thing was just a nightmare
for me by these little scoop lamps and

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:05.400
try to get them

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.610
to stay on the stands in their falling
over and they don't like to stream the

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.170
right way in just fighting with inviting
with you know and then it comes down to

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.420
it I still had to buy the light stands
anyway I bought these different groups

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.740
and all these are from light bulbs and
so then eventually once I finally had

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.840
looked online for a green screen kids
and I think like my green screen hundred

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.360
and eighty bucks in at that point I had
already spent probably $200

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.340
other things so that same experience as
you hear that does hold due to yourself

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.310
that was gonna save me so much money it
cost me the same or more in and plus it

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.050
cost me time on top of that with Iran
and then there are the aggravation and

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.670
when I was trying to shoot videos and
having to deal with this equipment that

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.240
was just now co-operating with me

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:07.230
angles and so they had you're like me
you know where the light right you know

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.160
though I see this big white thing over
here and I was going what are these

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.090
people thinking you know so it's very
interesting and thought it would be fun

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.420
if somebody just did a big school on
that I think you could do a class that

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.590
is just one big school you know crazy
think but anyways yeah it may be around

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:37.150
and service in circuses yeah so but how
do you feel about that now now that

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:44.820
you've moved beyond that time where he
was what these lights in when you look

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:51.880
back to you would you consider that is
why there was a way budget would waste

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.590
time there's a huge mistake or do you
feel like there's something you know

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.760
positive that you that you got out of
you know I almost like these things and

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.850
I think I'm a sucker for punishment but
I like it because I like the

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:13.230
experimentation and things like that but
you know there's a limit

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.739
is the big problem so that's another
thing that's very very frustrating but I

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:26.600
do enjoy it because it's what I do with
photography is bad and I can spend hours

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:33.810
in the studio just playing around with
it and so I think it's fun I can imagine

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.949
those who but this is different like I
have put on perfume eyeball

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:41.690
crime-solving I would have fun with
something like but I don't imagine that

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:47.150
someone that has maybe a business
background was class think so because

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:53.770
it's it's really not right you have a
business background and I mean how much

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.800
do you really wanna learn about these
city lights right well it's ok because I

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.880
mean with you in your situation it does
tie in with what your interests were and

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.410
that's part of why you're able to look
at this experience and say but I am

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.530
getting their skills and I am having a
certain amount of fun with it anyhow so

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:19.180
it's just you know sort of the process
overall dads providing you some type of

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.229
enjoyment and benefits

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:27.770
independence of the you know the the
courses in what the courses are doing it

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.710
just all part of this process going
through the reinventing yourself and

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.349
learning new things and picking up new
skills in your situation it's something

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:40.910
that maybe even does come in handy
because you are a photographer in doing

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:44.580
these other things with the video camera
and I don't know that sound necessarily

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.760
would play in so much with what you do
with your photography work but certainly

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.680
having experimented with the lights I
would imagine is something that you

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:58.639
could leverage to a certain extent even
with whatever your Portugal still

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:05.599
photography type of what it's helped
also is the truth is you know video is

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:09.340
getting bigger and bigger and everything
marketing and so it's helped me with

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:14.440
thought because I do a mini photo class
on periscope I started doing it and I've

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.120
got to develop you know keep them warm
ideas

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:26.639
teacher once a week sometimes that
doesn't quite work out it's hard to find

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:34.229
a restaurant you know to go in tanks and
and so all these things and sound also

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:40.229
has become important although with these
with periscope island it's okay for you

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:46.419
to have background noise because part of
the NBN is just put Udinese you know

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:53.800
stricter and stricter about it but so
tell me with with these new ideas to

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.500
take the classroom out of the classroom
and they've been doing that more and

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:02.900
more and I think that's a lot of fun
especially for me I can get out of the

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.590
house and computer all the time

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:17.300
right and you had mentioned very early
I'm talking about the fact that you did

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:25.840
you do like teaching and so what like
what have you done with your experience

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:31.320
with you know the lights are hot you
kind of have been able to turn that

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:37.229
around all your lights in your sound in
all of you know that kind of stuff that

00:07:37.229 --> 00:07:52.430
you went through are you want me to tell
you I'm not sure why but okay okay so I

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:58.070
was very silly because I thought you
know I know everything about lights and

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:06.330
I threw away receipts so I got so
anyways Home Depot lights what I do is I

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:17.070
like I don't use a very bright
background that works out fine for me

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:21.490
and then I used the video light so I'm
using everything that I almost

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:28.050
everything and they use the same way
that I would've photo lights I put the

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:28.500
night

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.110
nine goals which is really important
because a lot of people just put it

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:38.159
straight up and then they have this
horrible light and so I put them out and

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:41.870
collect that's very complementary and
you know I use them with all the

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:51.270
techniques that I have I don't know if
you haven't tried LEDs yet but I know

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:55.700
some other people have tried LEDs I
haven't asked him about those I couldn't

00:08:55.700 --> 00:09:00.110
get I couldn't get a good quality of
life for anything the only thing I like

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:03.940
this the one that I got a little button
but you could change it so blue lights

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:16.340
or red light and I could flare up so I
kept trying because I thought this is

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:26.630
small I can travel at this wonderful but
it's just I think I would love them so I

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:34.050
you know that things and it's
interesting because I what I did is this

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:40.339
your senior senior white paper and a
blue paper and I i turn my living room

00:09:40.339 --> 00:09:46.120
into what I thought was gonna be my
future i got rid of the furniture I got

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:52.830
all these flights and construction
started across the street and that's why

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:58.110
i cant take your tiny little room right
this hurting these lights all over the

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:01.500
place and trying not to get my feet on
them and things like that which is

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:05.530
really kind of funny which is probably
how a lot of two polar doing it right

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:10.040
not you know when you do when you're
starting and you don't know what to do

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:15.339
with what song but in almost a little
close but using techniques and things

00:10:15.339 --> 00:10:21.760
that I've been using thats why sound has
been such an issue for me because I

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:24.060
thought that maybe I could still take
that night
