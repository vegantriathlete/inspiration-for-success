00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.970
yeah I'm at 10 by 10 room myself to my
stuff and then plus like I've got my

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.880
desk in here so I don't have the full 10
by 10 of the room is a matter of fact is

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.030
you know the desk cut since he was five
min you know a narrower place there but

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.400
what i was gonna hinting with what
you've done with the experiences if that

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:25.170
you had all these and then you turned
around now based on your experience as

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.410
they can you have the experience is the
photographer and you turn that into

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.160
classes on you know me you have this
experiences with creating your first

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:42.980
course and so you've taken that in you
turn that into a course which is still

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:49.930
awaiting approval for whatever some of
the required fixes it there so it's

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:56.020
something that gave you the opportunity
to learn some new things and then give

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.660
you the opportunity to be able to teach
some new things and you know that

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:07.810
ideally other people won't have to go to
the same things that you went through

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.479
with this whole process

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:17.180
yeah so I I started to realize okay so I
turned it into this to get people to see

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.070
you know what I think I showed them all
these things you know how I went running

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:28.960
to about the lights and everything and
so my show them my experimentation so

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.780
they don't have to do it so they can
skip that part although it does look at

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.869
it you don't have to the shop me they
can go okay I just avoided that and then

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.890
I saw the you know how they could do it
but they are the difficult part about

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.570
this is that they're gonna be some
choices and and this is what I was

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.049
trying to think about action still
trying to iron it out a bit in the

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.490
courses I would love to give them a
camera option and I know there are a lot

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.479
of people that are still meeting with
the Logitech camera and I i did a test

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.369
with that in it and it's there in the
class so that they can see it and

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.220
hopefully avoid that outcome but I know
that there's a lot of people that really

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.020
like it and I even put

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.700
it on a tripod to see if I could get a
better you know till mid or something or

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.990
play with the angle the height of the
cup not shorten it because it's an auto

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.710
camera that reads whatever it is that
you have and it's very hard to correct

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:35.820
it so what I'm trying to say is there's
some people that were really upset that

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:43.640
I didn't I'm not giving them a budget
you know something I can do $400 but the

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.160
truth is when it come crying when it
comes to feel you need a better camera

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:58.420
there's no way out without it and even
when I use my I used this mirrorless

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.040
camera which is a really great camera
but it sounds fun plastic cover for

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.670
video because it doesn't track you can
look at this now when I write I get a

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.470
little bit out of focus and it's a
little bit I have Italian background so

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.410
I'm gonna look a little bit and so I'm
gonna be autofocus eighty percent of the

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.050
client and the two thought you're going
to be talking like this said then all is

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:39.750
good hope to buy of course that's not
why it's blocked by the way I'm just

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.080
sharing I shared the class with some
friends and I you know that's what you

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.459
think what else would you need or
something like that and also cheap

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.980
cameras and I'm like I don't know what
to do about the cover-up yeah yeah yeah

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.709
we all have our own situations we have
to figure out how to put the pieces

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:02.220
together here you know what works for
one person may not work for another

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.030
person and just like you're saying some
people are in love with that Logitech

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.220
camera they think it works well and you
say but like it was a disaster for you

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.290
can get it to work

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.510
you hear people as well talk about how I
create a course in five or five hours

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.530
for two hours

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:26.540
in the you know we look you've got to be
kidding like I can get one lecture done

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:34.419
in two hours we ought to figure out how
we're gonna put the pieces together for

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:39.980
ourselves in the shower gonna make the
best of it and then you know how also

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:49.380
we're going to use you would have in our
overall strategy in for anybody who's

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:55.270
watching this was not on you to me it's
not like whatever you do you still have

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:01.610
some way to Germany needs to put
together a strategy how you are going to

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.669
be dealing with the market in the hills
of whatever it is and if you're not even

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:13.390
dealing with online classes at all you
still analogous types of things that

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:18.610
you're going to have to experiment with
in be able to have a little fun with and

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:26.500
be able to learn new skills and figure
out some new things and so you know I

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:32.620
think it's really it is helpful for
people to get a chance to hear that and

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:41.880
it's good as well for you to be able to
be able to tell people like I can I get

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.100
this camera work for me that's just the
way it is now if you get it to work for

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:51.510
you fine but I can't recommend that even
this is my experience this is you know

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:55.530
the recommendations that I can make to
you the things that I think you're gonna

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:01.300
need to be successful in that it still
was up to the students who are taking

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.430
what they want to get out of it and
apply the stuff that works for them and

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:10.450
stuff that doesn't take from somebody
else you know what somebody else so

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:17.169
taking what you can get a person's
experience I want to give people a

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:20.000
chance and we if you want to ask any
questions

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:28.510
you can post them right here in the jet
stream and perceived here as well as

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:32.780
somebody wants to sit down and have a
chance to ask marguerite any questions

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.670
anything that I haven't covered that I
forgot about her if you just wanna have

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:41.210
a chance to hear somebody else's voice
and get my horror stories off the air so

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:49.610
feel free to jump on in and take a seat
and ask any questions that you have and

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:58.270
in the meantime I just like to ask you
what you're like what you see your like

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:05.640
near-term and long-term plans are for
this process of reinvention that you're

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:11.380
going through right now and how do you
see you to me and whatever else playing

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:16.690
into that one thing is i think im not
gonna do a house of Duty video course to

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:28.479
get that is not there was actually
outside of my comfort so totally but I

00:07:28.479 --> 00:07:33.669
you know I also watched the child mark
Timberlake and you'll have and I think

00:07:33.669 --> 00:07:38.419
that was an eye opener which is just a
little bit more focus in on what your

00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:43.820
specialty is and things like that so I
think I would stick to my the still

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:49.000
photography and things like that and
maybe think it may be doing a business

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.840
course I'm not sure there are so many
out there so I'm not sure if that's

00:07:52.840 --> 00:08:00.510
something very necessary but it is
something that you know that that is

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:05.520
something that I could teach that I I'd
like it's a super low but what you do

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:10.430
you know what I got a whole bunch of
these classes when they came out on sale

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:14.180
and I'm going to do a whole bunch of
them and really enjoyed them in the next

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:18.770
few months and then I'm going to see how
I'm gonna implement them so now I'm

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:24.590
going to place to do it for a while I
think I can I can I'm looking forward to

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:26.409
that

00:08:26.409 --> 00:08:34.789
in do you see just projecting a little
bit further into the future to you is

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:44.600
your idea they are you want you more
towards focusing on online and

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:48.870
delivering classes where do you feel
like you still want to be doing the

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:53.379
still photography and in the one-on-one
teaching like how do you want to balance

00:08:53.379 --> 00:09:00.290
those things I want to go more online
because I want to start traveling more

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:06.269
and actually kind of making plans I was
going to go around now but it's pushed

00:09:06.269 --> 00:09:12.029
forward so maybe by the summer I plan to
go to to Europe and I wanna go spend a

00:09:12.029 --> 00:09:15.029
year traveling wanna be a hippy or
something

00:09:15.029 --> 00:09:22.579
teenager again the so I would love to
just get more and more online cause then

00:09:22.579 --> 00:09:26.000
I can do that anywhere and that's the
thing that's not so beautiful about the

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:33.060
online classes I think so you're
thinking more about at least for a

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:40.529
period of time pursuing like a location
independent lifestyle yes yes and I'm

00:09:40.529 --> 00:09:44.439
not sure how I'm gonna do that it may
not work out but I'm going to test it

00:09:44.439 --> 00:09:49.649
out and see what happens you know of
course it's just a party or adventures

00:09:49.649 --> 00:09:59.639
adventure and reinvention of yourself so
it looks like people are pretty

00:09:59.639 --> 00:10:04.990
satisfied he would be taken as seen
anybody has any questions so we'll start

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:12.779
winding it down here so so last call
hoax if you wanted to comment on her ask

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:20.990

picked up from you know your experiences
you've had so far to all of you for

00:10:40.819 --> 00:10:45.559
starting of course take your time
learning everything before don't go

00:10:45.559 --> 00:10:55.339
crazy on the do it yourself very quickly
and read or watch some videos and things

00:10:55.339 --> 00:10:59.829
like that but I think online classes are
great thing to do I think they're

00:10:59.829 --> 00:11:06.259
wonderful supplement to anything that
you do and I some people do really well

00:11:06.259 --> 00:11:11.639
just doing bad so I think that it's
something that it's an interesting likes
