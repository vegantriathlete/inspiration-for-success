00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:38.430
making my fair share of mistakes and so
I really do enjoy doing these weekly

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:46.379
chats cause I get a chance to learn as
much as I love you get to learn they

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:53.079

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.290
on the site there you can ask your
questions as we go along we'll get to

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:13.580
them at the end so without further ado
i'd like to introduce my guest today

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.720
marguerite is a photographer and photo
teacher she has three courses on you to

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.750
me and is working towards finishing the
fourth one and just as a matter of fact

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.460
I did look at her profile and the 420
actually i think is is sitting out there

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.890
I just don't know whether it's approved
as the approval process but she's very

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.090
close to finishing her she teaches a
baby photography course of food

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.020
photography

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.350
food photography course for the
smartphone camera and an introduction to

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.020
photography class sold around to talking
to you about some of those classes from

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.890
but one of the big things are going to
be talking about today some of the other

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.659
things that marguerite does in her she's
using you to me to help her with those

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.020
things and some of the other benefits
that she's getting

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.660
out of traveling this journey so it's
not all about the classes that she has

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.480
published her waiting to published right
now if there's other things as well that

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.360
make this a worthwhile endeavor so
welcome to the show

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.250
marguerite what else would you like to
add to your introduction or just repeat

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:31.940
in case my voice is just a horse right
now is really quite good

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.069
no I think it did a great job into this
thing I am that's exactly what I do

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.000
right now I have a past life that I used
to be a stockbroker and Brazil but

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.840
that's so long ago that you know and it
was so there it is and so I look at

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.160
these courses I started looking at these
courses as a great way to share

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.569
information I thought that you did he
was very interested platform it's also I

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.870
think it's one of the easiest ones to
upload into work with did you find that

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.690
all troops tried and the other ones but
I think it is very user-friendly it

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.160
since I was just contacted by another
platform

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.130
the other day I've been contacted by a
number of different platforms but I

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.620
actually when I spoke with this one the
other day I said ok well it seems like

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.750
what you're proposing is reasonable I'm
willing to check it out and in fact I

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.840
uploaded one of my video lectures in the
audio is not playing on it so already

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.400
the experience with this is already
giving me problems so based on that

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.889
experience I would agree that I think
you to meet interfaces pretty nice

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:40.940
pretty easy to use

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.510
yeah yeah I thought it was I think they
work well with and they're working very

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:52.609
hard with everything they're so you
mentioned the past life and I hear you

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:58.480
there cuz I had a number of past lives
as well before coming to you when I

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.500
think it's interesting to hear about
some of the past life just getting the

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.329
back story so let's just gloss over that
you know tremendous detail about all of

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:12.560
the trade you made and all of your gains
and losses but do tell us about your

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.900
past life because it does kind of play
in to do

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.259
some of your experience in the things
that you feel that you're you're getting

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:24.470
out of this so you were in another
country actually in you were working as

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.710
a stockbroker and tell people a little
bit about the kind of environment that

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.350
you were in there when you were working
as a stockbroker well it was very

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.750
different from what it is now at this
because and I'm going to really ancient

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:44.990
but we had one computer in one room for
about 20 people so first of all it was a

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.320
lot more fun because everybody was
together and you had to be you know a

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.710
little bit fending with each other and
and you're all sharing this one computer

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.970
and so everybody shared each other's
issues problems and helped each other

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.979
because that's how you have to do it and
I was a little bit surprised when I came

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:07.960
here to the states and I went looking at
the different brokerage firms banking

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.349
interesting places like that and
everybody had this little cubicle and

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:15.990
one computer and no one to talk to each
other and I thought I would never

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.510
survive this cause I was used to this
group thing I'm not a group first and by

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:26.729
the way but it was so much more fun and
so coming from you know I thought you

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:33.000
know it's such a different world I I
really thought no this is not what I'm

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.370
going to do so that's when I decided to
go back to school to study what I really

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:46.070
wanted which was right and so it's
interesting that you came to an

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.830
environment where actually the
technology was better for you you had

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:56.409
more accessible to you but you didn't
feel like it was as good a fit for you

00:05:56.409 --> 00:06:01.940
in so you decided to make the change and
go into pursuing your passion for

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.460
photography so go ahead and tell us a
little bit more about that going back to

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.610
school and the types of things that you
did in school and in how this life

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:16.919
change how to play it out for you the
first School of Visual Arts in New York

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:19.639
and I thought there's something wrong
with the school cuz they let me in

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:22.289
pretty quickly

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:28.159
and stuff it easier to stay but it's a
really wonderful school I did my first

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:32.809
year there and then I moved to Miami
which I kind of regret because really is

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:37.889
a fantastic school you know and I learnt
a lot there and the thing is to have

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:43.009
access to all this other stuff you know
all these museums all these shows and

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:47.110
then you need all this other
photographers there's a whole cultural

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:53.569
world there that when I moved to Miami I
didn't get but I did have had the beach

00:06:53.569 --> 00:07:00.169
you know it's kind of nice and I finish
my education here and then I got after

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:06.249
two years of working around I got a full
scholarship to do that masters Master of

00:07:06.249 --> 00:07:10.159
Fine Arts at the University of Miami and
that was to get a really wonderful cause

00:07:10.159 --> 00:07:14.059
I spent three years just doing photo
projects and getting paid for it i mean

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:19.680
you know I didn't it was a whole nother
world again absolutely wonderful and

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.879
that's when I started being more and
more interested in teaching I got a

00:07:23.879 --> 00:07:28.529
little bit of a taste for it and and
then when I finish school I was teaching

00:07:28.529 --> 00:07:33.629
but driving around all over and I
thought this is this is a tough one

00:07:33.629 --> 00:07:39.139
yeah so I spent much more time in the
car than I did actual teaching so I

00:07:39.139 --> 00:07:43.339
started teaching online what you are
doing

00:07:43.339 --> 00:07:47.059
adjunct faculty that is that why you
were driving all over the yeah I was

00:07:47.059 --> 00:07:53.689
saddened that treat different
universities and it was created there

00:07:53.689 --> 00:07:57.300
was one that was about two hours away
and I thought ok now I'm overdoing it

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:01.779
I'm really you know this is a need to
rethink this again so what i think is

00:08:01.779 --> 00:08:07.219
really interesting is how life is just a
whole bunch of reinventing rethinking

00:08:07.219 --> 00:08:12.779
and trying to adjust what time I was
asked to talk in front of a whole bunch

00:08:12.779 --> 00:08:16.240
of students to tell them about my
experience and I think they wanted me to

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:20.419
tell you know and then I left school and
I got this job and I said well and then

00:08:20.419 --> 00:08:25.369
I said I did that and I did that they
were kind of looking at me horrified but

00:08:25.369 --> 00:08:30.139
the truth is I had to reinvent myself in
and fit in and create different things

00:08:30.139 --> 00:08:33.649
like this change you don't get one shot
now for thirty years

00:08:33.649 --> 00:08:40.930
ears I think so right now you are still
in involved in that process of

00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:48.040
reinventing yourself you're coming to
you to me and you're working to teach

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:52.850
classes and we'll talk about that
experience a little bit more and so for

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:55.980
those who are paying attention you kinda
notice where margarita sitting right now

00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:01.379
and she's got these laps behind her and
she talked about those a little bit more

00:09:01.379 --> 00:09:05.910
cuz their place in this whole
reinvention that she's going through in

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:14.240
the experience that she had with us so
you had an interest in teaching and you

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:18.970
realize that the adjunct teaching wasn't
working that Walker's you're spending so

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:25.069
much time travelling ya in so you
thought about doing some online teaching

00:09:25.069 --> 00:09:32.040
as you to me the first platform that you
came to to pursue 2009 teaching no I

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:36.559
think they are disgusted online and I
teach the business of photography at

00:09:36.559 --> 00:09:41.929
each portrait photography and will not
be used to teach the introduction course

00:09:41.929 --> 00:09:47.819
but not anymore so that was really the
first time I started teaching and I

00:09:47.819 --> 00:09:51.899
thought this is kind of interesting and
so then I started looking for different

00:09:51.899 --> 00:09:58.499
platforms where I could develop this and
and work more on it and did you the idea

00:09:58.499 --> 00:10:04.319
when you were looking at these other
platforms were you hoping that platform

00:10:04.319 --> 00:10:12.110
was gonna give you a means to a full
time income you know I to tell you the

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:16.480
truth I would love that of course and
and I think then something completely

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:23.569
different comes into play and thank you
and then I started thinking you know how

00:10:23.569 --> 00:10:28.549
am I gonna do this because with the
artist sister I have a few classes a

00:10:28.549 --> 00:10:31.939
year and and I don't have to worry about
well I don't have to worry too much

00:10:31.939 --> 00:10:35.959
about it and with this a lot of
marketing consent to play now we're

00:10:35.959 --> 00:10:42.679
talking about a whole different world
that I didn't know I'm learning but I

00:10:42.679 --> 00:10:43.630
didn't know

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:51.110
a lot about and so then how to how to
place myself as an online teacher and

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:52.480
they're all these different things

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:58.110
learning about social media something
that Wallace played around with but I

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:06.240
didn't realize that I was just going
whoa and you know I have to read just

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:12.820
what they say broadcasting and I was
marketing it so now I'm actually a bunch

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:17.020
of course these are new to me to learn
more about that that's what I love about

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:21.800
you because you have access to some
doing a little selfish you have access

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:26.870
to so many things and you can really
reinvent yourself right there which is

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:31.720
quite fabulous but it was so that's what
I'm working on now trying to see how I

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:39.660
came at least 50% of my could come with
their site I'm gonna figure it out
