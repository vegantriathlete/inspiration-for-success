00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.859
so yeah December is gonna be great if
you can of course don't worry about it

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:13.400
so yeah it's it's you know it was a
decision and it took a little while and

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.050
I had to talk to my wife and write
letters of credit check

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:24.470
basically give up I mean yeah today was
there was a sad chapter you know that's

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.640
that's likely that's over with I must
have too much time my ears up after

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.449
write the check

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.829
well united wanted you know Jeremy did
as well and will hold off my other

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:45.250
questions but in the profession so
software architecture is the design of

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.930
software systems not the coding level
but actually this thirty thousand foot

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.280
level your boxes in lines connecting
together and so just like any

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.320
professional lot of professions there
are standards you can you can you know

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.070
read a book and learn how to do it and
then do it properly or you can just you

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.540
know figure way in making you know the
Conrad hockey or whatever so there's a

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.200
standard and then there's a
certification so is the industry

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:23.220
standard for architecture the way that I
don't like accountants have a

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.200
certification in lawyers will look at
the bar but like you know network

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.130
engineers have a Cisco Certification
league every most technical professions

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:39.320
have a standard and took out his for
suffer architecture but you know it's

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.810
not super popular I'll say there's the
girls probably less than a hundred

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:50.540
thousand people worldwide who are
certified and 10,000 them two courses so

00:01:50.540 --> 00:02:04.080
10% of the summer detection market so so

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.780
sid will move in move into the stuff
that I know you guys are we here just

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.440
really quickly here one last question or
one last point that a joy to bring up

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.190
and I got did kind of mentioning here so
when he was starting on you to me with

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.620
this first course that exercise making
money and then he gets it with his DMCA

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:31.840
in these faced with the choice about
where am I going right to say it was my

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:43.140
first instinct I'm not I got no stomach
for a lawsuit money but what you guys

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:50.800
need to know if you listen to it was
just saying it's coming up on a year in

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:59.510
its time for Scott to pay again so this
course teaches it wasn't a matter that

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.720
you got to pay to be a member of this
consortium one time in now you could

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.959
always does all the toga courses I'm
going doing this every year he's got to

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:21.500
write so ok let's see if you can find a
this might be rare but if you can find a

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:28.480
protected market like that like if you
can find a I don't know there's there's

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.920
other organizations that do
certifications like WordPress has a

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.980
certification but if they do and you
take that you know testing you get the

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:45.220
right to teach it then you can have
WordPress do some of your promotion for

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.840
you right so that's like one option is
to find a a little electric cold that's

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:57.110
protected from the ocean of craziness
that's what I considered protected

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:11.060
market are a good so less now our way
into this whole idea

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:18.130
the topic selection so you with this
first class that you took used a while

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.919
maybe with synchronous city and maybe
there was a little bit of market

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:26.590
research that I did but you can you do
things a little bit differently it took

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:32.220
awhile to be honest my second course was
Google Analytics for you know me I went

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:44.830
off Google Analytics for you to me my
third class was just one-third like like

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.880
I went off in a different direction for
my third class and then my fourth class

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:55.590
was something else all my habit RPG
which was a site for doulas like I just

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:01.050
started doing top horses on anything
that like a tiny squirrel you know that

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.870
I just got my attention

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:10.310
hold way into 50 directions it took me
six months to do my second toga and that

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.330
was a huge success too but like why did
I wait six months

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:21.729
what what was I thinking do you not have
a strategy of september 1 least

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:30.140
September 23 you know so I was just I
was maybe fortunate but I've got a lot

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:34.729
of interests I take like I said I take a
lot of courses and if I was just doing

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:39.660
this with no strategy i would be doing
you know I thought about doing a

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:45.210
WordPress plugins course I ended up
writing a plugin course crushers that

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:54.860
Sean and I would doing so like I almost
anything and so I now do things with

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:05.669
intention ok so you got here it's an
evolution we all have things that we

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:11.969
need to learn when we come onto the
platform in hey you know what

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:17.389
a lot of things to learn myself I came
to the platform with a lot of

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:25.860
interesting assumptions and even having
started why some things I had to kind of

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.749
ships out so different in that regard
that he's he's had his things that he's

00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:35.719
kinda headed get some of the pieces
together as well so tell us then how do

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:42.319
you go about doing your your topic
selection right now we know what are the

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:47.779
types of things did you keep in mind as
you're going to decide that they were so

00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:54.809
there's a few there's a few different
strategies that they are some of the

00:06:54.809 --> 00:06:59.259
door my dog is going to have a little
bit for a moment so there's a few

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:05.749
different strategies that I one is again
I guess it about strategy I've got a set

00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:10.759
of related courses I've got my enemy as
CEO my Google Analytics for you know me

00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:18.099
now my topic selection is my third the
third step in that I can continue to do

00:07:18.099 --> 00:07:26.889
these interesting related courses as a
further stepping stone as I get as these

00:07:26.889 --> 00:07:33.909
things come to me and then in the
software architecture I want to I don't

00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:40.839
really think that there is a person who
can claim the title the king of software

00:07:40.839 --> 00:07:45.619
architecture on the internet and I want
I sort of had this dream of being like

00:07:45.619 --> 00:07:52.899
that brand name you know there's there's
people who you know try to compete in

00:07:52.899 --> 00:07:59.339
app development or try to beautiful
shopper try to competitive markets but

00:07:59.339 --> 00:08:05.409
if I can be like that guy that anyone's
ik you wanna learn suffered torture you

00:08:05.409 --> 00:08:09.069
don't know anything about him but I've
heard his name mentioned in that that

00:08:09.069 --> 00:08:12.610
space and so even if they've never heard
of you know me they've never heard of

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:16.529
anything if I can get my name in that
conversation so that's a that's a

00:08:16.529 --> 00:08:20.260
grander plan like I don't expect
everyone to buy

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:27.940
journeys here if if you know if you if I
don't know if there's a king of canvas

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:35.680
on the internet terms of teaching or
there's a king of you know command line

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:41.669
interface writing or whatever but like
to try to evict

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:48.170
to be that number one spot in even a
small market is one one thing that I'm

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:53.800
trying to go for so there's a there's a
there's a building upon itself but if I

00:08:53.800 --> 00:09:00.490
can continue the overall goal of topics
election is and I have this course but

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:04.350
there's two things that need to
intercept there's the things that you

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:11.230
know so everything that you can teach on
is in one sir and there's the things

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:16.080
that people will pay money to learn and
that's another circle and what we're

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.950
looking for is this overlap it could be
a small overlap could be a big overlap

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:25.380
but the currently interface at the
intersection between the things that you

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:31.840
know and the things that people will pay
money for there's a that's what you're

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:38.280
aiming for him so I I see people and I
don't mean to like pick on any one or

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:51.860
more like can I like like you know
there's there's the Drupal topic right

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:58.580
which is a very complicated tax topic
but will people pay money to learn

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:03.640
Drupal and maybe they will but what will
they pay money to learn what

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:08.150
specifically if there's a if there are
other courses on the internet if there's

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:15.980
classes you can go to in person what are
people paying money for in the Drupal I

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:20.450
don't know if it's the installation and
maintenance of Drupal that people are

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:24.430
pain or if there's some other time
related topic that's just you know it's

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:29.400
almost like not hearing the bulls eye
but just being a little like one foot

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.940
over from the bulls eye so it doesn't
mean the whole topic is off-limits

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:33.699
adjust

00:10:33.699 --> 00:10:38.859
in that space what are people paying for
and that's the research part you just go

00:10:38.859 --> 00:10:45.529
on and you search for Drupal classes
lessons you just try to find what are

00:10:45.529 --> 00:10:47.299
they

00:10:47.299 --> 00:10:52.269
the pain points that people who maybe
it's some of those people who are smart

00:10:52.269 --> 00:10:56.859
enough to install Drupal but are not
smart enough to write their own module

00:10:56.859 --> 00:11:00.660
that they need to customize something
like me I don't know but I'm just saying

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:04.410
like that the research part is important
