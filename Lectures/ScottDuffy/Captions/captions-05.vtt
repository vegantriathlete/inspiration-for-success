00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.419
another question back in his stream here
you have any quick tips for somebody

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:10.570
who's thinking of launching their first
YouTube yeah so if you haven't started

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:16.010
the creation process and you're just
like I got this idea I would search

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.770
YouTube and see what kind of resources
are available on YouTube if there is a

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:27.420
single video or two videos that
completely covers what you and probably

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:34.969
cover I'm sorry you're probably trading
over ground that's been well-worn so if

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:39.510
you know if there's 500 results and each
of them cover a minute or two of what

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.180
you would cover but not not in one can
to coherent form go ahead right so

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.350
that's 11 tip is like whatever it is you
want to teach if there's a free version

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.550
that is complete that is popular that
has 20,000 views

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.420
you've probably that gold has been dug
his Amazon Kindle ifile Amazon Kindle is

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.240
a much more mature market there's a
think there's more than shoot I'm gonna

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.979
see four million Kindle books in Amazon
right now maybe it's ten million anyway

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.930
there's there's multi-millions Kindle
books and there's 30,000 unique courses

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.890
and so yeah you there's romance and
action and you can probably cut away a

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.650
lot of those millions but there are
still many more Kindle books on topics

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:36.770
that might be W me then there are unique
courses so start digging around the top

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:46.049
100 top 200 top 500 list of Amazon and
you might find some good topics

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:52.259
Jeremy s about if you've ever used John
colleagues on the scope information to

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:59.960
do course research curse search john
colleagues had a course about a year ago

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.810
I took in August August of last year I
watched one of his courses

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.729
I it was introducing I'm disco and it
was interesting that visualizations

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:16.860
I know he just launched I mean he's a
co-winner of the Black Friday challenge

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:26.590
and his courses on these these searching
you know me I'm not I will I haven't

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:43.310
really looked at it it's a no I am I'm
yeah no comment and let see Tony wanted

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:52.200
to know about again this is the research
eg number of searches that you look for

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.630
to decide whether something is going to
be so you know me doesn't release

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:03.090
information if you can believe it I
emailed Lindsay a year ago and I said

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.400
Lindsay how many people are searching
told us and she told right but I then

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.870
you know some months ago I emailed her
again is that how many people are

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.150
searching this is because we don't
release that anymore so they used to

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.989
release the search data and then now
they don't so you only have these proxy

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:27.630
information in terms of how people are
actually searching this is why I like

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:34.530
the Amazon top 100 top 200 you can see
they call it be a star which is the

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.370
sales reading so you do see you wear
those topics are selling on Amazon

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:46.350
that's a good proxy you can also look at
the competition so we didn't really talk

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.400
about competitive analysis too much with
the new enemy but if there are like I

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.530
was talking about how to make money on
unique courses you know I think I

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.260
searched Excel like like Excel is a
topic and it's one of the most popular

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:07.700
topics on you know me but there's over
400 courses they search for Excel

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.760
that to me is just like you know so I
would I would look not for searches but

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.500
I will look at competitors if there's no
competitors or there's competitors but

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:24.660
they only have 10 20 40 students that's
not a great sign so there's courses

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.290
there but nobody's buying them but if
there's too many competitors it's magic

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:39.090
in between so that the best way to
answer the question we know when you're

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:45.620
talking on the web searches if you did
something like what is good post too old

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.040
now

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.690
planner

00:04:52.690 --> 00:05:00.510
keyword planner I would see I prefer to
look trans to give a key where planner

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:06.360
over keyword planner is good for when
you've already got the topic in mind and

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.610
you're just trying to find the key words
do I call it you know

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.510
installing Wordpress or do I call it
were present situation you want to

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.660
compare against B&amp;C which is the better
term Google

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:27.690
planner but if you wanna see over time
that the topic is growing or the topic

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:33.740
is popular and is maintained in
popularity go to Google Trends if you

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.919
want to see that the topic is like a one
out of a hundred and no one's looking

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:50.760
for it that's my advice for me it's got
we're in seven minutes till you

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:59.000
mentioned there is other stuff was there
anything you wanted to throw out there

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:12.040
and talk about some more SEO stuff I
know where it the first day

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:18.030
of Black Friday here and you know you
know in a way you would have had to

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:22.510
really started a couple of weeks ago to
three weeks ago to get your course like

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:28.450
like pumping air in a basket a little
early to be in that that beneficial

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:34.300
position but it's not too late as we
still have you know ten days left in the

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:41.850
sale and then there's the cyber monday
sale at me so we can talk a little bit

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:48.770
about SEO stuff so I just like the main
people the main way that people find

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:55.450
courses so they're getting their
directed by Udinese marketing to the Uni

00:06:55.450 --> 00:07:01.790
home page and then they're like what do
you want to learn I want to learn I keep

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:06.020
coming back to WordPress WordPress I
want to learn you know Photoshop and

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:11.750
they'll enter that word into the keyword
search box so the first thing you need

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:19.750
to really know is that those people are
using so if you put your twitter has

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:24.300
from instructor to student if your
student and you're like I have a problem

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:28.360
and i'm looking for a solution and they
go online and on you know me and I like

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:35.490
you know how how to get to the top of
Google or how to like there's they've

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:42.330
got some words that they like to use
find out where your course ranks in

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:49.200
there so I I would actually when I first
heard of my enemy SEO course I was

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:54.460
talking to a guy who had a photography
course and his courses called how to be

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:58.700
a photographer I was the name of the
course how to be a photographer and I

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:02.980
said well your courses on photography
right yeah but you're not using the word

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:08.630
photography right so that's like my
first thing he's on page 84 photography

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:14.600
and I know you're not use the word so I
really like how to be photographer

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.060
that's my

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:20.210
my brand that's what I love well I don't
know if people are searching

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:26.800
photographer in the universe just
relatively photography would be higher

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:32.469
search and he eventually did change it
took about a month after I told them to

00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:38.750
you finally changed it anywhere from
page to page 2 he he may be among the

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:46.710
top of page one by now but he really now
I never got a thing but anyways he liked

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:51.570
resisted so think about the words that
people use to find your course and if

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:56.230
your courses not rating highly for those
words

00:08:56.230 --> 00:09:00.580
well unfortunately I use those words
more lets you know if you don't use them

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:08.339
at all then that's your problem that's
one questions around a CEO or are

00:09:08.339 --> 00:09:20.220
getting higher rankings and you know me
that people have similar names similar

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:28.010
names whether you're going to be there
and actually is taken some strategies

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:39.920
because they played out about how
Udinese scores relevance algorithm that

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:45.960
uses so they can count of the number of
words that you and how many times they

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:50.000
keep it appears it strips out things
like that and you know some of those

00:09:50.000 --> 00:10:02.490
things but so is there you could search
for you know I don't even know what I

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:07.700
would do it live but you could search
for a topic and the number one course

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:14.520
like if you search for ILS the number
one course is how to develop 14 iOS apps

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:20.890
details inside like the title match
takes up the full length so obviously

00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:27.350
rub personal number one spy not just by
keywords alone like the fact that he

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:29.110
sells more courses in a day

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:34.920
day than most people sell in the whole
month he's gotta be higher ranking

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:40.200
factor for him and that gets into the
top so it's not just how much time you

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:46.550
can say iOS iOS gonna be number one
because the number one has something you

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:56.510
don't which is you know so that's that's
part of it is is the key words if you

00:10:56.510 --> 00:11:00.100
don't have the key words then you're not
going to appear in the top of that

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:06.040
search so that's like you have to have
the right words the length isn't is a

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:11.370
factor if you're struggling in search I
would shorten your title make it murky

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:17.810
and shorter if you are doing well in
search of course I don't just come right

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:20.630
become an enterprise a Certified
Enterprise Architect

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:26.100
TOGAF 9.1 part 1 I've maximize the
length of the title and a number one

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:32.230
number one and two so what's your number
one and once you're near the top you can

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:37.100
just use your title to the full extent
but if you're struggling and you're on

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:39.050
page 64 quartet
