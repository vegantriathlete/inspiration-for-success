he's always been a big help in the you

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:58.170
to meet studio and time that I thanks
much so that myself I live in Toronto

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:06.900
Canada so I'm a Canadian eh I'm got more
than 20 years experience in software

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:14.109
development web development some people
think that the techies have an advantage

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:18.889
and there may be some truth to that but
I've got that's where I came from and

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:27.459
can't can't change the past and Yahoo I
discovered you mean probably just came

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:28.880
to my attention

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:35.310
year and a half ago I have a site called
course mania where I embarked upon a

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.290
journey of taking as many courses as I
could and I discovered

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.630
Coursera Udacity in some of these nuke
sites where they've got these college

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.609
and university level classes and I just
started taking them anything that

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:55.489
interested me there was no particular
rhyme or reason and I will blog about it

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.489
so I started a blog around that and
that's that's what led me to you know me

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:04.739
as soon as some unique courses came on
my radar I was like what's this thing

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:10.889
that I can create a course so yeah
that's i mean I'm Union me my first

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:16.850
course went live here just over a year
ago here in a couple weeks my I just got

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.519
the last year's Black Friday

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:24.580
good timing for you will have to ask you
more about that this figure out topic

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:31.669
selection at that point actually be able
to but we get into topics election I do

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:37.970
always get background on our guests a
bit of the backstory talk about someone

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:44.220
came to you and you've already hinted at
some of that stuff so we'll just dig in

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:51.710
a little bit more so you did say you you
come from a tech background in that

00:04:51.710 --> 00:05:01.340
gives you a bit of edge me which will
discuss their but I know that you got

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.139
these toll here

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:10.580
courses so tell us a little bit about
what you what you were doing in tech

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:21.530
like before you ever started doing any
type training so in Canada worked for a

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:27.190
number of really big companies are
really here's my first job was with

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.740
petro-canada which has an oil company
used to be government-run and became

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:37.880
prime it so I was working with mainframe
systems and you know I can tell you a

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:44.110
funny story my first two weeks three
weeks on the job I just graduated school

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:49.599
at my first job they said ok we've got
this change we want to make to this

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:54.940
calculation it's a mathematical formula
embedded in some program in a mean frame

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:00.860
that's your first assignment so I dug in
there and I tried to figure it out it

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.460
was a very complicated program and i was
just you know as green as as they could

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.880
and so I went in and I made the change
but then I couldn't figure out how to

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:16.120
test it I don't know you know the text
of remarks to but whenever you do

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:22.390
something you have to test you may not
know this sometimes but but

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:28.820
in reality so i cant figure it out dole
is so complicated I was like how I can

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:34.060
attest but I'm only changing when number
from one thing to another so like what's

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:39.470
the worst that can happen so I pushed it
into production I just click the button

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:44.360
and its live and the following weekend
was a long weekend or holiday weekend

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:50.700
and the vice president of Canada for
Ontario's driving to his cottage up

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:57.860
north of the station and they were out
of gas and he was pissed off cuz you

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:04.250
know there is no gas to get a competitor
and so when it came back to work on

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.920
Monday like a

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:12.300
what happened luckily my boss was really
good he's ok well what kind of gas

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:17.910
station allows itself around a gas but
the blame on them but you know big screw

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:25.600
up the first my first real programming
assignment in my life so yeah story

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:38.010
there probably be pretty pretty scary I
I had a reasonably large mistaken which

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:43.940
I took donna production website myself
early on in my career they change that

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:47.020
they really quickly and again that you
as I call this is a tiny changes just

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:55.540
getting pushed up in a day productions
whoever this video that site is the

00:07:55.540 --> 00:08:10.080
project manager meanwhile there is
anything but the way that they can cause

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:14.690
the gas deliveries automated computer
just decide when to deliver gas to the

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:23.900
stations and I would you give that to
the first student joins anyways that's

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:28.780
already started it started in there you
know i i join the web early days so I

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:29.670
got

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:31.460
Bell Canada which is a

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:38.550
national phone company here in Canada
and I created one of the first web sites

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:45.990
web applications in Canada and the
biggest one that you know at the time

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:54.370
get this they used to charge for
browsers eg Netscape 0.9% $99 companies

00:08:54.370 --> 00:09:00.830
and so people used to pay money to get a
browser software like nowadays you can

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:07.440
just Firefox IE Chrome I got my choice
of million but the Bulls were the days

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:15.990
were so I started on the web really
early so I trained really really yeah

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:23.310
maybe to tie into our discussion here
because I actually remember when they

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:29.610
charged for browsers although I wasn't
the programming I was doing I wasn't

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:34.380
even really internet at the IDM 403

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:39.820
computers but it's like yeah you know
they charge for browsers and now look

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:47.930
browsers are free market mentioned the
digital products have gone like how you

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:55.459
used to be able to see the whole market
is changing its coming down to use doing

00:09:55.459 --> 00:10:02.079
right now and in Delhi in this whole
idea that the importance now of your

00:10:02.079 --> 00:10:07.120
topic selection because you don't
necessarily have this ability the way

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:13.000
that you used to produce this premium
praised course in maybe you just make a

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:23.529
few sales of it by getting these people
here there that disrupted by like if

00:10:23.529 --> 00:10:29.120
you've I used this example of katana
sword sharpening yesterday somewhere

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:36.110
you've got a course that's like a topic
thats so narrow there's other options

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:38.460
for you including opting out of

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:42.190
promotion and just doing so

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:52.340
ok well as well during the course of our
conversation folks if I forget to come

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:58.540
back to that just put a note the chat
session here to remind me to say about

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:04.250
that again so so you started out as a
programmer is that what you're doing

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:11.780
right now are you still yeah right now i
i work I do my own company so I'm a

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:18.720
contractor or consultant I'm got it
right now with indigo which is the Canon

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:24.270
version of amazon.com like everything
that I work for is the Canada version of

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:30.450
something right so I'm looking for
indigo but hopefully I know a few months

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:35.690
time I won't need to talk for anyone
I'll just do my own thing on you know me

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:36.540
that's my plan
