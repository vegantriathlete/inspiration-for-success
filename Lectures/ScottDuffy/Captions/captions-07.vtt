00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
now I may have at least one of course we
can go and I sold three today so that

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:13.769
the goddamn I gotta start somewhere
right and actually days then a

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.990
particular I think tomorrow will be
better than today this is my prediction

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.619
I'm putting it everywhere I think it's
all people know that as you to me is on

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:31.060
sale yet known you know me people don't
know is I gotta say my Black Friday

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:38.260
sales aren't exactly rocking my world at
this point so you have to have to like

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.500
it's like when people are searching you
to me to solve their particular problems

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:52.640
they may go and buy two or three or four
courses so there's a volume increase but

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.989
unfortunately they're gonna still follow
the same path of searching or browsing

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.670
it was more browsing sales today but you
still have to be found in search and you

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:10.920
still have to be bound to a browse so
that's unfortunately the patterns of

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.869
searching and buying are going to be
similar to what they were before Black

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:22.509
Friday directly alright jamie is gonna
gives you a chance to ask another

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:33.390
question when this thing as a little
Banerjee so my question is i've noticed

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.700
that now since I've been on you to me
and searching unique courses when I go

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.250
to Google and look up something I'm
getting you to meet course searches at

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.320
the top of my list so what are your
what's your experience and tips and

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.229
tricks for not just SEO for you to me
but also for ranking on Google is it

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.579
isn't the same thing like a fun making
course titles and stuff I need to be

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:04.719
aware of Google need to worry about it
or need to do anything different than

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:08.100
that great question

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.680
so first of all Google search and you
let me search our difference and the

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.510
things that you need to have to google
are going to be different things that

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.550
you need to be have at the top of you
I'll say like this you tammy has perfect

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.990
information you to me knows how many
sales people get per day right you know

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.900
me knows that when they show of course
people don't buy it and so they'll show

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.160
a different course next time and the
conversion rates and all these things

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.420
are you to me has like the data Google
Google Google just has clicks you know

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.560
like quicksand links backlinks so the
other thing to know to his Google

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.950
personalizes the results and so I don't
know if you're searching google and you

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.590
see course your course at the top of you
at the search that may just be good for

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.950
saying well eclipse on you a lot let's
give them some are you to me links so

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.150
Google has a little flag a little icon
that you can switch between personalized

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.490
results and the generic results so I
would say also whenever you're doing

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.970
Google research turn off the
personalized results and go to worldwide

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.640
there's a globe iconic because the non
personalised so that's the first thing

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.420
the second thing is i mean Google's
gonna care about back links right we are

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.160
in a Eurocontrol you know me so you
don't have the domain authority they do

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.810
know that how many links there are two
if they do you know what's in store

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.130
ratings and things are there is
information Google has Google gonna be

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:51.450
more natural language so if people
search how do I learn can vote while

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.660
they're going to say okay must be how do
I learn must be a course and got that

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:03.360
intelligence to the keyword base so yeah
there isn't there is a slight difference

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:12.050
he said for the problem is you mean is
not your domain is not our demean

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:17.680
Sean was here he would say why would you
ever spend money trying to build up you

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.350
to Me's

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:24.230
SEO for their business right cuz there
someone gonna come to your course and

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.830
they're going to be offered three
different courses you might also like

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:33.370
it's not your like so you might be
better off

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:42.300
worrying about how your own site ranks
how your own home and then funnel people

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:50.630
get that kind of a CEO so those are
conflicting things I know but but yeah

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.330
you know but if you do wanna go down
that road I would start linking to your

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.930
own course on your own website trying to
get those links to the web comments on

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:07.750
core Decorah kawanzaa twitter has now
Google's indexing Twitter so getting

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:13.210
those links out there will build that
backlink authority the traditionalist

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:19.780
CEO way and I'm not a super Google SEO
by any means but that's the way you do

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:27.420
is you get your links that and I had one
more quick question for you and you

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:32.610
think well we'll wrap up after this
cause I have to talk about this a little

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:38.340
bit earlier regarding titles but I can
you talk more about percentages of

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:44.570
keywords to your title is it better to
have WordPress course versus how to use

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.780
WordPress because there's a less
percentage and the latter versus the

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:57.710
first one and then you know things
jeremy has been an awesome participants

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:06.020
so yeah the percentage of thing now
there's a concept of keyword density in

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:12.260
Union EU to me actually room warrants
keyword density unlike Google Google

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:17.110
would look at that as being keyword
stuffing but you know me does reward and

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.260
cities so

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:24.640
you know if if you're doing a course on
Wordpress in terms of keyword density

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:31.060
the best title you could have is
WordPress one word one keyword hundred

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:37.590
percent density and so maybe the second
best is WordPress WordPress now that's

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:41.650
on a very good title and that go
WordPress WordPress what's that

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:46.330
so you gotta be careful there's a
there's a fine line but that's what I

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:51.110
said earlier if you're struggling in in
search you do want to shorten the number

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:56.010
of words in your title you don't want
anything touching your keyword so don't

00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:01.260
put WordPress in brackets do not have a
high fin connecting the word WordPress

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:09.630
with the word coerce with no space like
your keyword has to stand on its own

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:15.860
very simplistic and so if you're
struggling you want to get a shorter

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:22.320
title I don't like the word how to win a
title because they're on you know me

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:28.100
searching for a course of course it's a
how-to like it's it's it's unnecessary

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:36.920
so it's almost better to see like
something like installing Wordpress or

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:41.490
WordPress advanced techniques or
something like that word you don't need

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:47.770
to put course you don't need to put how
to that's those are unnecessary words

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:53.200
and you're just diluting your keyword
Mark said earlier that they ignore and

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:58.660
or how I don't i don't i don't think
they do but I don't have that evidence

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:04.190
that they don't think they literally
count each word and how to something

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:14.480
something course is for extra words what
ya never know because if you remove it

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:18.409
and you improve or you don't change what
does it mean

00:08:18.409 --> 00:08:28.649
market go ahead and do I gotta go get my
