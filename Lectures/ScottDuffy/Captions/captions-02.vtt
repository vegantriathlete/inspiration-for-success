00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.759
ok actually Scott doesn't got right now
could choose to talk about their little

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:12.030
bit more later is well he's got could
actually right now be doing what he's

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.359
choosing not to do you quite at the
moment so we'll see how much of his

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:31.840
secret plans can squeeze ya so so you
were taking courses at Chris media are

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:42.570
not Christmas for Sarah and I mean
there's a whole bunch out there and I'll

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:51.739
be right now and so you happen to come
to you as a student at first you just

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.760
taking these different courses you
remember the first course was that you

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:02.910
took when you when you are one of the
early ones was a Google AdWords course

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.030
and there was a really weird course no
thanks to the person did it but it was

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.250
basically how to protect yourself in
Brazil I dismissed Brazilian guy had

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.939
done a chorus line when you come to
Brazil you know like put your money

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.710
inside your your pocket and don't like
it was like a protection protecting

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.979
yourself in Brazil its he gave it to me
for free so well you know to spend a

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:37.520
forty-five minutes and then write a blog
post about it so early was really just

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.780
like amateur which is which is great

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.130
people who are not traditional teachers
and not the Rob personals and not you

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.030
know these hundred thousand $1,000,000
structures normal people

00:01:50.030 --> 00:02:02.810
delivered courses on a couple of topics
was how I got into it ok to take courses

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:11.400
yeah but protecting yourself during the
World Cup was around that will take

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:18.500
courses I teach courses on anything to
an extent the topic tell us what was the

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.250
first course this Utah what was your
first so I'll tell you what happened was

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:32.030
I was working for a company and as an
architect and I I had a friend of mine

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.370
tell me he there's this architecture
certification

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.120
TOGAF have you heard of it and I'm like
no one ever heard of it as I go online

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.299
and that's really interesting because
it's what I do for a living and I'm a

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:51.549
big believer in certifications I've got
a lot of certifications as well so

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.580
that's really would be super interesting
and then when it started to research

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:01.900
what courses were available there wasn't
a mean they were all super expensive so

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.350
$2,000 for an in-class training and the
best I could find was like eight or nine

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:13.540
hundred dollars for online training for
this topic in and say that's sucks like

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.100
you know those are my options and then
Mike then you to me was like you know

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.250
when to ideas come together you're like
wait a second I want to learn something

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.989
for myself it's so expensive and I've
been looking for something to teach me

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:36.519
to make a few extra bucks so my first
course was the October Halloween course

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:42.380
creation challenge they did last year
and a month and I took the test passed

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.739
the tests did a course on it I know
there are some people who would that

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.049
gonna find that controversial that I
learn the skill while I was creating a

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:58.510
course on it but that's that's how I did
it I see that that course has been very

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.319
well very good for me yeah

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:15.150
45,000 students almost all paying so you
can do them out and so this was

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.489
kind of just a good bit of synchronicity
for hizo at that point where you really

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:26.039
in this mindset about topics election or
hate you just kind of got like I could

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:31.060
call it like I I was aware of you know
me I was a member of the studio Lindsay

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:40.090
announced this course creation challenge
and then a friend of mine says hey so it

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.630
was it was serendipity if you want to
call it that so the confluence of

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.090
thinking about it

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.860
vs opportunity and recognizing now this
is where you get into top selection is

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:59.060
being able to recognize do the market
research thing is in demand and the

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:06.160
current things that are supplying are
inferior in some respect so you got some

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:13.449
personal interest I've got you know lack
of supply and I kind of know there was a

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:18.539
man's right so it did appear on the Hot
Topics list the Buena me at some point

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:27.070
so there was demand I knew there was not
supply side ok own you know you're in

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.750
the right place at the right time

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.650
alright so you do this

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.430
TOGAF course it is all peaches increase
I'm you know I don't want to impress

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:44.560
anyone but I got my first I i price the
course of $49 when I launched and I got

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:50.880
my first sale before I was notified that
the course was proved so my forty-eight

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:56.250
a $49 sale that afternoon that it went
live and that's how I knew it was live

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:03.270
so sadly now I I got 12 courses and not
all of them peaches and cream and so

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:08.750
this is how I have all my thinking over
time in terms of how I select courses

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:15.340
but that particular course I mean
perhaps is the reason why I'm still here

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:21.639
right so if if I didn't have the success
I had or if I had chosen to do

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:26.319
my Google Analytics for unity course
first and not gone into the toga stuff

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:29.580
who knows what I would be where I would
be right now

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:46.909
work of course I want you to give people
a little bit behind the scenes well I'll

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:53.419
tell you one thing about ok so if anyone
knows there is currently there is a

00:06:53.419 --> 00:07:02.560
great market for it is is owned by this
company called The Open Group or manage

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:10.129
that and it's the same group that owns
the UNIX standard UNIX in toga phone by

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:19.009
group and if you tried mark isaacson to
create your own UNIX product and called

00:07:19.009 --> 00:07:24.189
it Mar communiques you have a lawyer
contacting you within a couple weeks

00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:31.779
saying you're not allowed to use the
units trademark and please stop so I got

00:07:31.779 --> 00:07:40.580
a DMCA notice 30 days of launching so
there's a story right lawyer michael has

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:44.360
taken off of you know me you know me was
threatening to refund all the students

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:52.069
and I had to make some decisions in
terms of how I was gonna proceed that's

00:07:52.069 --> 00:07:58.129
what I was hitting it with this this
teaches in cream here because he

00:07:58.129 --> 00:08:03.430
identify the cores that was it actually
was a good topic

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:09.000
starting students making money and then
he's got a lawyer

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:19.500
yeah he's got lawyers around yeah I mean
this is only a maybe

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:27.790
so all of this kind of stuff in so here
Scott had made some money but he's got

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:33.190
these lawyers breathing down his so what
exactly did these moyers want what was

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:35.740
your choice

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:43.479
my first choice was how to respond right
so you get this DMCA notice and your

00:08:43.479 --> 00:08:48.950
course is offline you mean that put into
Dr state or whatever and no one can sign

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:55.790
up and so a DMCA process we're all
familiar mean a lot of us are you

00:08:55.790 --> 00:09:00.800
familiar with sending the MCS I send you
know eight or ten of the month to

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:05.890
different sites are to Google but to
receive one you have to choose how to

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:13.170
respond you can ignore it you can find
it ok so I thought I had to call a

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:18.080
lawyer I had to pay some money to get
some consultation and in the end I was

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:25.530
like well this is a DMCA case the NCAA
is a copyright law and so I would then

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:30.089
have to have been copied their content
with all the content was my own original

00:09:30.089 --> 00:09:37.089
content I wrote it I i wrote created the
videos they claim that I copied down now

00:09:37.089 --> 00:09:40.880
they have the right to the trademark ok
just like UNIX has the right to the

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:48.750
units trademark of Microsoft ok so this
kind of a leg to stand on but its DMC is

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:56.970
not the 24 so I ended a counter counter
filing a week week and a half and I

00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:03.360
basically sent another thing to you know
me saying i dunno can test this and if

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:07.670
they want to sue me sue me that's
basically what I said in my counter

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:12.150
flame was I know this isn't copyright
violation not covered by this law not

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:18.170
covered by this technically they broke
the law when they found his DMCA as I

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:24.190
didn't copy them so but I I was you know
I'm just a guy I don't have infinite

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:28.190
resources I don't want to go to
California and fight a lawsuit

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:34.310
so I had to make a big decision what
ended up happening was I had to pay for

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:40.480
a membership in The Open Group and so
now I am one of the consortium of

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:45.060
companies believe it or not that is part
of the open and as part of my membership

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:51.590
I have the right to use the trademark
and teacher so I basically basically

00:10:51.590 --> 00:11:02.500
paid a fee and it's been very good to
know that he's been worth it but its

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:08.380
point that was from our previous
conversation was pretty much in the

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:22.150
vicinity more or less than what you had
already decided to just gonna pay this

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:27.050
fee and basically that way all the
profits that I had and I'm gonna clean

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:35.450
and that end and I'm not gonna you know
reproduce that success in December

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:43.090
January February or like a rocket that
came back down to earth or would there

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:47.300
be a chance of this continuing to put
that in context November was awesome

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:52.080
December was terrible right and so when
I got a cease and desist in January or a

00:11:52.080 --> 00:12:01.750
DMC in January like well do I go off of
member to member like Jeremy thats

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:04.750
December was was not that great for me
but

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:09.120
November and January good so it was like
a roller coaster
