00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.919
ok good where you are so right here so I
want to ask you because you know I did

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.880
you know consideration for you are you
good to hang out a bit more I'm gonna be

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:21.330
done I probably have to leave in about
twenty 20 minutes or so so so let's go

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:30.949
ahead I'm an open up a replay of others
Jeremy so that Jeremy in to ask a

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.360
question on a lockout this seat so we
only get one in this year

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.860
yeah they'll be replaced me when I got
on your mind

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.050
relations the big winner one of the top
10 thanks

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.670
first of all I want to say thank you
Scott

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.710
course when I first are using you to me
and anyone who's watching this

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.020
definitely take shots course because it
has helped me tremendously I still use

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.809
the stuff we talked about in force to
this day and you know it's got your

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.650
awesome you're always on Facebook
helping people out so I really

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.030
appreciate it

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:13.920
one thing that I had a question helping
50% annoying when they had a question

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.740
about was earlier you mentioned that
show graph problems that she had

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.900
legalistic issues do you know of any
other companies copyrights or anything

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.009
that we should be wary of trading
courses other copyright infringement

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.280
logos or or anything that we shouldn't
be using that you've heard up I don't

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.140
know if you know that answer but you
know I don't want to go out and make a

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.619
solo shot course and then you know
Photoshop tell me that we can use it

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.979
yeah so do you know any more of those
and I'm gonna go ahead and sign off and

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.189
leave the seat up enforcement

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:56.469
Jeremy that was appreciate the kind
words and every company is going to have

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:02.680
some sensitivity over the use of its low
right so Facebook will care about how

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.570
its logo is used as well as WordPress

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.039
as well as other companies now generally
if you're clear that you're not Facebook

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.209
and you're not associated with Facebook
they probably will leave you alone but

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.380
you know there's there's going to be
lines to cross my where of any others

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:31.580
besides TOGAF UNIX there are a couple I
haven't really done the research what I

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.840
would say is so once you've decided to
do a topic if it's Photoshop obviously

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.550
you can go on you know me and you can
see there's like 200 Photoshop courses

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.910
and they all have that box the purple
box with the BS in the blue box of the

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:52.060
PSD Photoshop or Adobe After Effects use
the logo and so there's some comfort in

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.450
being among company right so having two
hundred courses that infringe you're not

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.010
going to come after you haven't come
after the other two hundred

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:10.580
I guess that's going to be part of your
research I would have to be careful now

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:17.200
for me I get it I had no ill effects
other than my bank account being

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:25.019
depleted for that moment I didn't really
have any ill effects they didn't they

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.579
just asked me to stop and you know i i
worked it out with them

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:36.890
call them up on the phone and said hey
here and they said check so you know if

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.620
if if you use a logo of WordPress and
WordPress doesn't like it

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.630
change logo and shouldn't cost you
anything that's my advice I'm not a

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:54.510
lawyer am NOT your lawyer he doesn't
either

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:02.500
anybody else wanna jump in here and grab
a seat to ask Scott question why we got

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.239
him here for another few minutes while
we're waiting to see some Scots got

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:12.200
anything else you want to throw to see
you go

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:22.889
looks like you're gonna be a bit light
on in Australia so the era with this

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:26.980
Black Friday and Scott I want to say a
huge thank you you helped me out a lot

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:36.220
and it's been a huge range from a can
you tell me how it impacts would go into

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:42.860
your SEO course now and you told me to
change something in my calls based on

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.250
the instructions you're gonna give me
and that cause is there anything that or

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:55.389
do you live now or any ranking operate
God and the Black Friday so they really

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:00.650
need exercise three or four times in 283
my mike has just been in like eight

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.870
o'clock in the morning and have a clock
in the afternoon my time and midnight so

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:10.600
there's three or four times a day that
the enemy site three indexes so one

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:16.760
thing you can do is if you just want to
try your title is no change it change it

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:22.590
now and then six or seven hours come
back you should see in search the new

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:23.600
title

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:29.030
you should see your position go up or
down and you say oh that worked

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:36.220
own legend work so now Black Friday
maybe the dangerous a time to be playing

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:43.889
with it but if you are if you are not
satisfied with your search results so i

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:49.220
cant im sorry I can't remember exactly
what your course is on or not

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:55.660
yeah I've got one thats just teaching
people how to create a visual book using

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.430
text book Lowell and 72 hours so that's
how to get yourself up on Amazon

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:05.380
six-figure from non-fiction books so I
would say that

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:11.470
York your Kindle book with a particular
tool you probably have the most

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:16.060
opportunity to improve your your title
there I'm see the title and I don't know

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:16.960
for sure but

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:23.699
if you if you put the word Kindle first
and then finish it or if you said you

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:28.990
know you have a particular name so those
are you know using tools and brand names

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:35.180
are great search SEO to people I was
searching for how to make a six-figure

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:40.750
business is more like Generic

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:50.639
profit on targeting almost exactly like
offer may be a good word I know there's

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:59.240
people that searched writing or does the
that's a different skill set and author

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:07.610
so you know I would say it's it's it's
probably OK to play around I would if

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:11.580
you were happy with your position you
just wanted likes screwed up one more

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:17.460
maybe I wouldn't completely unhappy here
like I searched author and I'm on page

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:25.470
eat well worse right so to me on page
for reuse of the page eight is is worth

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:30.509
to try and play around with this so if
you whether you took my course I'm not

00:07:30.509 --> 00:07:34.719
if you started habit now I'm gonna go
play with it today

00:07:34.719 --> 00:07:43.669
my ranking so all of alcohol can other
people have questions that was alright

00:07:43.669 --> 00:07:56.419
see something Australian friend I'm
friends with Sean K and he's he's also

00:07:56.419 --> 00:08:01.300
has a Canadian that's been transplanted
Australia and so I attacked him a lot

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:09.210
about his new home country has been
there a long time but I want to venture

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:11.380
into that now leverage area

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:20.390
ok anybody else to jump in and take a
seat here and got a question we got it

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:26.420
few minutes left where you have to do
that I'd take the chance I think we've

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:34.380
done a pretty good job of my dreams I
don't let anybody out there too badly oh

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:45.960
ok my body found there so I'm very
curious how my sales are compared to two

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:53.050
funds has an Android course that is that
is highly rated and is also in the iOS

00:08:53.050 --> 00:09:01.450
category that's you know talk about me
in a hot topic that's hot market so I

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:10.940
would be super curious I've been pretty
happy today it's it's been steady so you

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:18.120
know it's like thats I would see how do
I put this in adding that doesn't give

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:24.390
away too much I would say it was like
two or three times what I did a week ago

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:27.440
so yeah ok
