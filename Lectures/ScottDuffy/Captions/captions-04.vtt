00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.970
so let me follow a bit and Scott is
getting a here with the example in by

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.009
the way Scott as of this morning I'd
actually I that's one of the courses and

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:18.449
I'm revisiting that I realized that I
purchased it was just that I had that I

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.890
needed I needed to launch my first so
you got a pic of course pick something

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.939
you know that you can be able to do
quickly as I created this course that

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.050
was it in the way the title stands now
as I haven't finished filling out the

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.750
course was not successfully install
Drupal easily and quickly and that's

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.170
what's got getting a steak but are
people really gonna be interested in

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.989
to learn how to install Drupal and you
know what I can tell you conclusively

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.430
the answer is No

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.420
although I mean I some sales on the
course but that's what are the problems

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.000
and I'm having with a course is that it
isn't sexy enough to people don't get

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.710
enough of anything when they finish
their courses this is so good at being

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.610
able to see oh cool now I can install
Drupal and I'm definitely gets course is

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.320
going to be completely expanded in
revamp it reproduced but the point that

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.710
out here not to get tied up in specifics
of course is that he said ok so maybe

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.020
there's this idea of Drupal and Scott
doing this with some of his courses like

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.740
there's here's where maybe all this
couple is yours like this idea here

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.740
maybe 280 right on top of this year the
best place to go but if you're near it

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:47.979
and make you the opportunity I use my
office an example of how to me

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:53.790
course course how to make money online
courses right I don't have the how to

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.860
make money on YouTube course I may never
have a hard to make money on YouTube I

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:08.240
have a course and I have a topic
selection course so Jason too

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.610
the oversaturated market but I'm
addressing a very specific need people

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.420
are asking in the studio every couple of
days how does your research we're like

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.470
I'm on page six and I've got five stars
and the guy above me has no stars and

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.830
NYC above me and there they get this
point and so apparent you know

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.820
apparently no other course that's
available on you know me how to make

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.590
money on you to me really adequately
addresses how did you know mister

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:45.990
literally if I'm on page five and I want
to be impeached to give me five things I

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.820
can do tomorrow and then next week I'll
be higher in the rankings so I had a

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.230
particular pinpoint a particular
solution and I covered it completely and

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:02.580
I do it and what i think is a logical
way and three questions all these things

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:10.460
so I'm not trying to compete with Alan
hill with Benjamin Wilson are all these

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.220
people who've died you know me how to
make unique course courses I i dont need

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:23.610
to like i'm happy being 101 from that
bullseye and and I think with my SEO

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:33.460
course it's not like you know it's not
buying me a car but it's ok I got you

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:39.850
know was worth my time and it's also
interesting to me so it's sort of like I

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.320
wouldn't have any regrets even if it
didn't sell that well but did okay so

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:49.590
yeah like any any comment that you can
think of I would say the challenges just

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:56.030
finding that place to stand on going to
be different you gotta be better one or

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:05.260
the other and I'm going to the best you
know I'm gonna beat Alan hill at how to

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:11.180
make money online courses so I'm gonna
try

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:22.930
ok doesn't seem like a bad attitude I'll
be over here while he's over there it's

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:29.889
not a bad attitude you are seeing that
there's a lot of competition you're

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:36.570
gonna have getting in you know that over
an area but you can find a different

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.900
area that you don't have it being kind
of competition that same kind of

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:48.380
challenge meeting a need because there's
a point that's got me and he said

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.110
find when you know what you're
interested in and also find the

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.639
intersection of that with what people
are looking to learn in what they're

00:04:54.639 --> 00:05:01.509
willing to do so when talking about
staying awake he still is looking for

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:06.220
where there's going to be some type of
pain point he said some type of problem

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:12.070
can solve for just randomly running away
from a scuffle and say I don't want to

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:13.900
be part of that i'm gonna go do
something

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:20.729
complete 180 degrees opposite he wants
to be close enough to it still there but

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:26.789
he just caught up in winters you know
all that competition so maybe just

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:33.449
reinforces the question why wouldn't you
and I don't know that Scott said he

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:41.490
wouldn't but why wouldn't you create a
one day thing like like alan has got he

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:51.630
publishes his income reports and he can
he's made $30,000 in a month and so that

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:57.310
thousand dollars a day and I mean I'm
not making thirty thousand

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:03.880
like so what am i competing on my
standing there saying well guys I've got

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:11.159
ten percent of the students that alan
has I make a good living but you know so

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:14.080
well I do it if I do it'll be different

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:19.539
it won't be the same how to make money
on you know me course that that 1020

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:21.340
hundred people have

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:30.680
you know that I just have to be
different I'm sorry I'm not resolve the

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.300
real problem like I said the top US
elections are real problem because a lot

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:43.600
of people launched a Facebook group and
they see hey guys here's my you know

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:50.850
WordPress course what do you think
there's a huge need for that is that the

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:56.419
biggest problem the huge giant problem
that you're going to stall like I could

00:06:56.419 --> 00:07:03.900
when I install WordPress I click one
button and install not even as difficult

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:09.250
as Drupal used to be I don't know but
the latest one more like like it's it's

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:14.090
not something that people are are
killing themselves in the freezer so

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:23.490
it's I just want people or motivate
people to to just spend hours spent two

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:29.580
hours searching around and find
something just different and who knows

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:36.680
hopefully you'll you know rocket past
the people that are all in that same

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.370
thing

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:43.680
ok we're at a crowded at three-sided you
want to roll through the stream here and

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:57.550
make some of these questions that the
incident yet to actually be an

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:03.080
interesting a chance like no holds
barred about what do you plan on

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:10.010
removing your courses to your own site
and that actually also ties in to turn

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:18.090
off this distant bring us back to the
idea the high price promotions

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:21.500
answer to the question about

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:26.430
staying on your platformer attracted
because there's a lot of questions and

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:32.180
we still talk about so I'll be quick but
you know I have a mixed feeling about

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:36.840
pulling courses off of youtube if you
look at the most successful in

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:42.539
structures on you know me you're looking
at the personals debentures to people

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:52.350
that you know me gives their love to all
those people are loyal ok but does not

00:08:52.350 --> 00:09:00.190
have his site on teachable right now so
there's that part of me that's like well

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:05.960
I can be a good soldier I can you know
I'm doing well I wanna keep doing well

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:12.870
so maybe I'll just ending a better what
I'm doing and not be all like five

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:19.400
different places but then the other part
of me is like people are paying $800 for

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:23.760
TOGAF training online I'm selling my
course there's people that pick up my

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:31.280
course for $10 on an Android using a an
affiliate code and I get $1 75 the end

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:39.970
of the day so I'm like damn I'm not one
to question these $10 codes I love them

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:51.150
75 is like my coffee is $1 ninety my
daily coffee so I am trying to drag

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:56.580
instructor there's this conflict between
I don't want to jeopardize our risk my

00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:02.190
income nice seeing you to me would
purposely sabotage anybody but I do

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:12.120
think that I do you think it's like any
business you want to invest in people

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:18.310
that are showing you know showing their
loyalty to you so when they're deciding

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:22.260
among all the courses that they're going
to send an email whose course of their

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:26.060
picking right now they're still taking
mine and I'll continue to

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:33.900
hope that they do that so I am
considering it but who knows if I do I

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:37.490
will put my courses I remember if I do
I'll create a brand new course and

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:40.510
upgraded somewhere else that would
probably be the strategy
