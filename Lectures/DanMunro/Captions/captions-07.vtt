00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.850
child a little bit together for people
here again folks it doesn't matter

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.840
whether you're making a yummy chorus or
a digital product or whatever you're

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.809
trying to launch in your life here to
take the things we talked about in

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.130
figure out how you take that and put it
into place for you so let's wrap things

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:27.859
up with this last comment that I was
making about the bachelor she's lost

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.869
weight she's doing she's got these
changes that she's making in her life

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:38.320
but oh yeah that doesn't mean that she's
got it all resolved yet do everything

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.090
resolved right you got it alright and
yeah totally perfect it's really nice

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:50.890
yeah this is this is important like I i
develops my vulnerability and rawness

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.920
honesty over time and i know this still
deeper levels I haven't even touched it

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.070
what I realize I got very comfortable
with being able to shield my mistakes

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.430
from the past being our share my pain
from the past it has since healed or i

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.890
think is here and as with one label of
vulnerability to kind of show people

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.080
that you weren't always perfect but as
you've identified the next level to show

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.520
that you're still not perfect and it
took me so long to overcome this barrier

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.810
because I thought well lose all
credibility you know if I haven't got my

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.970
life 100 C completely sold it you know
nobody's gonna work with me and that's

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.130
just total bullshit people only want to
work with someone that they can relate

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.079
to people don't want to get advice from
someone as perfect as they can't imagine

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:38.360
being perfect they have never been
perfect

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.369
understand what it means and they can't
possibly imagine somebody who is perfect

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.020
understands where they're at the thing
and some of the pain that I currently

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.909
experience is what's going to help my
clients the most was really interesting

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:59.390
is how my coaching is a bulbs and so
often now that my my coaching sessions

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.170
involve me telling about something that
I haven't yet sorted out in my life as a

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.060
way of relating to the personal coaching
you know so they tell me about some pain

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.009
there is nothing like that so at the
moment the south

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.340
and that helps them so much because they
can see it and somebody else usually

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.310
they can see the solution themselves as
so often the case that we can give the

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:27.400
advice we can't follow rights so often
like like I see the emails that I see no

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.170
to my community the ones that get the
biggest response other ones around

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.159
talking about the things go wrong about
the things didn't go well for me that

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:41.299
painful things I experienced the
awareness thats that has come from me

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.390
realizing that I've still got deeper
levels of authenticity to uncover that

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:51.599
are still got more confidence to build
and this is what's really this is there

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:57.799
it's their garden thing with the plans
that kind of growth the most the ones

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.470
that are all the journey with you are
trying to catch up to your destination

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.889
necessarily but they're watching your
journey I love seeing this guy grow like

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:12.010
being part of it I like I like having
been there from this position seeing you

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.579
get to this position and the only gonna
see that if you open and honest about

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:23.949
your feelings and your weaknesses
regularly and in real time and to go

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:29.329
over something that we had talked about
in the session if you could just see

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:35.109
give people this metaphor that you would
give in about two mountains and people

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:40.500
standing on the mountains and how that
plays into you know what you're saying

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.220
about being able to somebody else

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:50.079
yes I tribute this one dr. Russ Harris
is one of the leaders and Acceptance and

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:54.060
Commitment therapy huge influence on my
work

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.380
so all coaches affect anybody probably
running you know me cause is going to

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.060
have those boys going who might tell
someone else what you might help someone

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.319
else when I don't have my own shirts
ordered and it's really it's really

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:13.260
beautifully put this this metaphor so
what my coach says he's on his mountain

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:19.160
climbing a mountain and you can see me
climbing mountain over now from his

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.030
perspective because see the path that
I've taken and you can see the possible

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.930
Pasay could go to keep climbing so he
can yell out advice to me you know he

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.460
can see can see where I'm going better
than I could see myself because he's got

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.870
their perspective on his mountain he
says Scott rocks in front of those faces

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.130
as confused as anybody about where to go
next

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:44.430
so he's got his courage on another
mountain yelling out you know so the

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.500
idea that we need to be perfect we need
to be at the top of the mountain before

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.630
we can help someone else is total crap
we can be amiss in still help someone

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.180
else because we have a perspective on
their lives that they cannot possibly

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:04.610
air and if we open about our own
insecurities and more open to seeing the

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:10.110
the amount and their journey and an
unbiased way I'm trying to hide what's

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.830
wrong with me if I'm trying to make
myself look good I'm gonna be very

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.060
judgmental about them as well as gonna
biased my perspective I think you should

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:24.320
do this something I should do that but
if I let them just got a call

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.250
also my stuff out when it's my time now
stay at times I'm gonna look at this

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.120
stuff and help them with their stuff you
know but that's that's an imposter

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.510
syndrome that we all give me helping
someone in a voice in your head saying

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:41.200
you're not good enough to help someone
else you don't need to be just need to

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.389
have a perspective that will help them
you can be there can be more successful

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:50.330
the new by any measure you want to use
every area of your life and you can

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:56.930
still help them because they can't see
what you can see excellent so I hope

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:02.169
that that's a nice inspiring note for
everybody who

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:08.830
watching us right now to understand dead
we all had the ability to our

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:14.939
perspective in our perspective that we
have is different from the perspective

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:20.580
is somebody else is able to have in
their own situation index value that we

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:27.800
want to bring is our perspective in our
ability to see so much more about what

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:37.389
people are experiencing in to bring them
to help them with the journey that they

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:44.219
are so with that I will wrap it up
thanks so much for being great

00:06:44.219 --> 00:06:48.749
conversation with me Dan thanks so much
for willing to be willing to take a seat

00:06:48.749 --> 00:06:53.020
sorry so I know can be hard for people
to be willing to get on air especially

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.029
when we're talking about some of the
stuff that we're talking about in this

00:06:56.029 --> 00:07:00.770
conversation where it's not quite as
easy as some of the other type of chats

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:03.740
that people will have your marketing
strategy let me ask somebody about

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:10.860
marketing strategy being willing to get
on and say hey my problem is that I lack

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:15.649
confidence and I don't want people to
think so I appreciate your willingness a
