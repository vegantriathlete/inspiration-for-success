00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.629
yeah and as a result you weren't able to
form which you were really looking for

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:10.940
was connection with people in whether
you wear your nice guy phase or you were

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:16.100
in your pick up artist these you weren't
actually establishing a connection with

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.500
people so you weren't getting what you
wanted to get out of the hole

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:27.779
interaction anyway now there's something
that you mentioned just a little bit

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:35.050
here and I'd like you to talk about in a
bit more depth when you talk about being

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.450
honest ensuring that we did you feel of
people so even though when you are using

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:46.860
this direct strategy for the pickup
artist in so in theory you were telling

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.579
people how you really felt there's a key
part of that that you still allowing

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.480
years experience as you say that was
vulnerable et so little bit about

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.659
vulnerability and and how you know
that's right you frozen up a bit on my

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:16.310
end I dunno if you can still in me but
when I noticed was there I thought the

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:24.600
people connected on the smoothness
thought that people connected on your

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.430
back then you dropped out there per
second technical difficulties folks who

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.600
have to hang in there is in New Zealand
and will have to give him a chance to

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.409
make his way back in here let me i
unlock the seat so that when here he is

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:46.280
again I see that he's shown up there go
ahead and i got the seat open for you

00:01:46.280 --> 00:02:03.790
can take a seat again there

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:11.520
yeah we go is here I can see up in the
top then they are you see your refresh

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:31.450
your browser here damn it will give you
a chance to take a seat again

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:38.000
or technology and Internet it's
wonderful when it works it can be a

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
disaster breaks down so far so good we
haven't had a problem with these plans

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.319
but I guess there's always a first time
for everything right so in here for a

00:02:48.319 --> 00:03:00.180
bit and see about to reconnect year you
work hard just went from six to seven so

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:07.410
I'm hoping that there is alright lemme
get this you'd like to dance on back up

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.980
again

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:18.549
alright so I don't know what you're
aware when you dropped off a we had

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:24.840
heard last were talking about the
vulnerability in which that people were

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:32.360
responding to and then you kinda cool
site when I realized as I started

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.810
looking at deep relationships start
looking at people who I thought were

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:41.730
really truly connected like I look like
a couple where somebody says been an

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.430
accident and one of them said to care
for the other one for a whole year and

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.329
they just have no secrets lift you know
like when you had to wipe your partner's

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:55.239
us you know everything there is to know
about them there's nothing to hide and I

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.780
start looking these actions I also
looked at the few connections I head

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.329
there were Rio with my best friend or my
family as I was different about those to

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:08.549
the connections were actually oh it's
shallow I feel these barriers I feel

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:14.420
isolated and it was about sharing the
darkness and what I mean by that is

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.039
talking about the stuff they isn't going
to please people will listen your mind

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:23.300
you think it doesn't talk about the
stuff you're ashamed of your

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.400
insecurities your fears doubts all the
stuff that doesn't make you look like a

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:36.220
hero shows that your real human and the
kinda stuff and so I started

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.650
experimenting with being more open
around this so letting it come out

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.230
naturally as a came up

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:48.720
and it's been amazing to see what
happens when you see your dockside was

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.700
someone else one of two things gonna
happen either they're not gonna see

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.600
eye-to-eye with its gonna have no
alignment for the gonna push them away

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.520
so you should do something with someone
else and that and they leave but the

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:08.580
other people going to go to the
connection we have something in common

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.970
like we're both into playing guitar this
is something like we're not trying to

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.080
learn how to play guitar like I just
keep banging my head against waters

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.910
could make any progress I came so close
to giving up so many times and the other

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.210
person they might not play guitar but
they like yeah yeah those like me when I

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.070
was learning how to play golf and the
connection happens in the Shi'ite

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:35.830
suffering and sorrow that kind of
commiseration the sympathy and

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.040
compassion that comes from hey you were
both humans are being human's hard work

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:45.500
you know being human is fine for a lot
of the time and that's where a real

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.540
connection here so my final transition
away from picking up my guess was to

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:55.360
actually allow people to see their raw
vulnerable side of me and in doing so

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:01.790
inviting them to do the same number
tation or they wouldn't and I would let

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:06.870
them go if they didn't but they did we
could go deeper and you get to a point

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:12.490
where eventually you just having awesome
conversations all the time you have real

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.610
conversations and no more talk about the
weather I know how was your weekend none

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.290
of that bullshit anymore

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:25.600
conversations like what we're talking
about and that was that was the final

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.680
transition for me is like a I'm gonna
let people see the bits I don't want

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:36.480
them to see and just see what I yeah you
found that things started to go better

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:46.310
starting to be able to wrap up things
that people could do to make this type

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:51.030
of a difference in their life and so you
want to head in you tried to write it

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:52.300
down right

00:06:52.300 --> 00:07:00.759
yes the beginning my first my first
dropped my first book about two weeks

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:08.110
and it was it was awful just awful but
it was a start I just like I had all

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:12.599
these ideas my man there's so many
people I see out there that could

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:15.919
benefit from what I've learned you know
without having to go through all the

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:20.490
shit I had to go through the limit they
could make some shortcuts so i thought

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:25.389
well 00 put it all down my book is
mostly just exercise a lot of stuff that

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:29.819
I used when I as a probation officer to
rehabilitate guys on parole and stuff

00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:35.919
like their goals adding stuff by 10 then
I gave it well took a long time to build

00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:39.629
up the courage to do this but I
eventually gave it to six people and I

00:07:39.629 --> 00:07:44.270
said just tear it apart like go through
it and tell me everything that's wrong

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:54.719
with it and the course that conceived
the idea that came back then it was just

00:07:54.719 --> 00:08:02.020
too cold and impersonal and really so
when I read the next edition is twice as

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:06.849
long and full of my personal story and
the stories of others and that's when it

00:08:06.849 --> 00:08:10.880
closed for people to show my goals
heading towards boring until you show

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:15.099
them how you know person X applied it to
their life and they had to go through

00:08:15.099 --> 00:08:21.219
these barriers and it didn't quite work
and I get to see it for real and that

00:08:21.219 --> 00:08:26.460
was the beginning of everything that's
you know once I saw that they could help

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:30.819
people I thought how else can I help
them how else can I work with people to

00:08:30.819 --> 00:08:37.169
share these ideas and yeah that's what
branched out into

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:47.140
so when you first time even though what
you were writing about was how you

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:53.660
discovered in being vulnerable was
making this difference you still weren't

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:59.510
ready to be vulnerable enough to include
your story

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:23.530
written it in a way that there really
was no so you this but even as saying

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:38.940
I'm ready to practice but you didn't
share you mentioned working as a parole

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:46.090
officer and I do want to go back to
their let's put it in context and it's a

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:53.040
little bit we got to hear about your
background and then I started working

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:59.510
for you in hour in rewind it a little
bit to go back to when you were in this

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:05.100
nice guy Hayes and what type of jobs
were you when you were when you were

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:12.190
still in there but anything that
somebody else to just go for me so nice

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:14.460
guy is like one version of being a
victim

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:21.490
there's a lot of people out there victim
life which is like to you like a twig on

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:26.310
a stream just caught up in the current
just flown about doing what life tells

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:30.660
you to do or following up the path
that's been cut out for you by somebody

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:37.900
else and so I ended up the kind of jobs
I ended up and we're just like easy to

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:44.060
get safe secure jobs now arrange them
everything from working in a warehouse

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:48.930
to landscaping all selling books to
librarians at some stage for some reason

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:56.460
and it was all just safe easy now if we
are really first are making a shift is

00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:00.440
when I start to work for corrections I
had this degree in psychology that I

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:06.940
hadn't used and I thought I should do
something with this cost me a lot of

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:08.560
money to do so

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:12.460
looking to psychology related jobs and
that's right now on probation officer

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:18.240
and as one of the first real moves ever
made was to you know what I'm not gonna

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:22.880
go from gonna go to this this we had job
thus probation thing I've never really I

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:33.390
don't know what they do exactly you know
as I that's a big holes and so yeah that

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:38.400
was the first time going into in my
degree was one of the first moves I may

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:43.140
actually doing something for me but this
this job was really it because it's put

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:48.870
me in a position where all of my fears
were going to be brought up you know I

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:54.410
had a huge thing about being a nice guy
is fear of confrontation nice guys

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:57.880
absolutely choked up in the face of
confrontation because it's a warning

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:02.460
sign that someone's going to disapprove
of you which is our greatest via so I'm

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:06.839
going into a job where 90% of the
conversation too confrontational you

00:12:06.839 --> 00:12:10.740
know you're talking to guys who don't
want to be there to be the illegally and

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:15.820
these are anti-social guys you know I
was talking to murderers and rapists and

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:23.360
gang members and guys are just from a
different world to me and I who are more

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:27.810
than happy to get aggressive than to
manipulate me into you know screw up my

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:32.110
mind and it put me in a position where I
had to learn the hard way I mean I got

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:36.860
manipulated so did the first couple of
years I was just guys have me wrapped

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:46.420
around it and after all it's obviously a
risk you know I was at risk of doing

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:51.020
something wrong for my job or just for
my own self worth having a guy like to

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:55.930
view 40 years pretty hard on the also
once you find out about it and so I

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:59.800
started learning how to have
confrontations I start learning how to

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:06.650
assert myself and to use my values to
guide myself when I'm confused or being

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:11.080
manipulated and things like that and
after a while this comes standard

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:15.400
screening out the rest of my life I mean
when you can stand up to a big belly

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:20.260
tattoo gang members like breathing and
stared at you you know some of your

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:21.970
bosses and so scary

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:27.779
only that the girl you like body isn't
so scary anymore and I started noticing

00:13:27.779 --> 00:13:32.379
this ripple out so I started practicing
being assertive and all these different

00:13:32.379 --> 00:13:36.730
areas and each time every other area
going to be easy it's who you know so

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:43.550
you could like tried here and you know
so then job was crucial because not only

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:47.389
was I practiced saying all these new
skills I there but I was getting

00:13:47.389 --> 00:13:54.689
training throughout that psychologists
and stuff I really really helped me just

00:13:54.689 --> 00:13:56.709
unlocked my mind so much more
