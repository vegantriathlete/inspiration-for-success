00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.309
yes so as far as winning things out to
tell people you know a bit about how

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:15.690
you're using you to be right now cause
you to me you you've got to me and you

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.880
do have plans for other courses but you
to me is it really your end goal in this

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.779
year's research will give you a chance
to ask questions and second they were

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:32.360
taking a seat so glad to have ya so just
what are you doing with me right now

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.390
because just also into the recent issue
chosen not to be our Udinese promotions

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.010
so how is that playing into your
strategy of what you're looking for in

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.020
your you know what you're building in
your life right now

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.860
yeah I mean I also believe the closest
they have three main reasons one has

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.960
that kind of I don't like calling
passive income I'm not a big fan of that

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.590
way but it is a source of income but
that's a minor reason the two main

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.530
reasons firstly is reach so I've got a
message I believe is important to share

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.020
of got some support I wanna give to the
world but I can't get to the mall so an

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.810
online program has like the best current
way to get to as many people as possible

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.080
and coach them as best I can without
actually being there so it's also like a

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.509
legacy think if I died tomorrow their
programs on the air for forever you know

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.890
so whatever I've got the best of what I
got survives and hopefully get past all

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.020
the other things about my god it so
somebody comes to meet the coaching

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.770
after having done my program they are a
highly qualified person is somebody

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.890
knows exactly what I'm all about

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.380
they must like it because I've been
through the program one more than the

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.680
kind of person is gonna get so much out
of coaching you know they're going to be

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.930
what I call a light touch I get this
kind of all coaches get this kind of

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.719
guilt when someone so easy to work with
that doesn't even feel free to charge

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:00.950
them you know just like say three words
to them like yes got it nothing

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:07.649
unchanged but essentially the program
will qualify those peoples somebody goes

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.030
through the program like it thus are
right for me and this is also

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.900
what they're really saying is that the
kind of person is going to get shoes

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.650
value out of coaching the and I'm gonna
get so much joy working with the you

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.030
know so the program is actually part of
an overall funnel that leads to Kochi

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.380
you know it's a part of an overall fine
I will build my community follow the

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.370
right people and they said their price
point that excludes kind of person is

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:37.239
not willing to invest in something
that's why I wanted you to me

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.880
promotions because people going onto the
course but she's looking for a course

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.920
it's under $10 is not necessarily a kind
of person knows how to invest in

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.150
themselves come visit knows how to take
responsibility

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.150
someone's looking for their cheap deal
they usually come looking for a quick

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:59.560
fix this PC in my line of work this is
you know if I'm buying you know if I'm

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.800
buying a set of curtains or something
like that you know I'm gonna go to the

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:09.489
cheapest indications or whatever and the
same again with the impact there are

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.980
some people who literally don't have the
kind of money for the cause and this is

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.760
a way that they can get it but also
really I think if if you can't invest if

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.320
you can find a way to take risks and get
uncomfortable and investing in yourself

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:27.360
for my calls very difficult to do my
calls constantly promotes going out and

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.320
getting uncomfortable and taking risks
and doing things that you're not sure

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.160
how it's gonna work out and letting God
the safety net so it acts as a way of

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.370
Khan screen that I don't want someone to
go onto the course of this does nothing

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.370
for me of course it does nothing for you
it's an online video it's not going to

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.019
ship for you that's what you gonna do
after you watch the video that matters

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:55.590
so all of this kind of all of this kind
of it all works to constantly upgrade my

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.390
garden you know to create their
community that makes me feel like I'm

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:05.780
doing something important in the world
we're at about five minutes 23 are you

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.700
able to hang out for a bit more because
it's so nice to have somebody willing to

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.480
take a seat want to talk to you in a
nice to be able to get more than five

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.410
minutes and if there are other people
like to be able to ask questions as well

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:25.420
would you be okay okay thank you so much
for taking a seat go ahead what's your

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:31.969
question I just started

00:04:31.969 --> 00:05:05.529
I know I can now move on their part of
that is I know mark but I just don't

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:14.329
know enough eject it or what I have any
confidence in my ability so you can't

00:05:14.329 --> 00:05:18.449
have been that procrastination with the
fear of the final product data being

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:25.769
seen by people that kind of thing ya too
so let's have a look at the existence

00:05:25.769 --> 00:05:29.989
huge there are so many people out there
right now with the course almost ready

00:05:29.989 --> 00:05:38.429
for you to me or did they just chance do
their final step so what I what I'd like

00:05:38.429 --> 00:05:42.839
to think about is the idea of there is
never gonna be a time when you don't

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:49.209
have these thoughts either a time with
your brain stop saying you're stupid and

00:05:49.209 --> 00:05:53.989
you're not good enough and all that the
brain just does there it's a little

00:05:53.989 --> 00:05:58.619
video flip through the Mac on the I'm
not gonna love story that we all have

00:05:58.619 --> 00:06:03.389
enough kids so this isn't about turning
off their story is about learning how to

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:09.099
take action with their story playing in
your shit so if we look at say posting

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:14.059
the course on you to be as being this
kind of teen editing for fear that they

00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:18.229
might seem so actually loaded up there
that people see it that's false fear

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:27.860
what would be a one entity in what would
be something is slightly uncomfortable

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:38.039
one out of 10 I guess let me rephrase
associates say when the stage read 10

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:42.159
out a teen is actually loading the cause
up onto you to me and letting people see

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:45.190
it right like this that's the most fear

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:56.840
and let's say five oK so that's ok so of
Tina Turner's completing the course and

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:03.450
loading it up so maybe a one entity is
just doing your next video does that

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:05.140
make sense

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:15.800
yes so what happens if we look at this
Final Cut final product will look at

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.400
this meeting the course on you to me and
we just go to hell no thats so

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.790
intimidating that so overwhelming that
thing is you can't get their calls are

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:28.610
new to me until the next videos done
anyway so you don't need to make the

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:33.200
decision about putting the calls up on
you know me at the stage anyway so to

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.420
think about it to focus on that as a
decision-making tools not really helpful

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:44.810
for you at this time it's the small
mixed it was after they are you free you

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:49.010
can buy on the whole thing if you want
it doesn't matter but saying I'm gonna

00:07:49.010 --> 00:08:01.100
get causing me to get the divorce is a
big step but the thing is like we often

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:05.800
overwhelm ourselves with their final
product idea you know like once is done

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:11.210
and all the stuff that will happen
because of their but I always just use

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:16.330
that the next stage is just what is the
next day one small nicks did so what do

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:30.270
you think that is what they want a tea
next video on something I hadn't made a

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:44.870
video for just one show intros attempts
but haven't just been there are only

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:53.470
about three or four top except cover i
guess im just what I know I know that I

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:56.570
can help people that's what I want to do

00:08:56.570 --> 00:09:16.310
so if you want to make your next video
with their topic be making as the actual

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:23.730
making of it you don't need to go
anywhere until their videos done there's

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.720
no further decisions to be made

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:32.450
yeah that's what I call quantum you
break things down into the smallest

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:36.320
parts and you realize that everything in
your life is Linnea one thing happens

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.450
after the other

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:42.030
which means that you're looking at Step
5 out a teen you're losing track of

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:50.640
12345 cannot happen until 12 37 states
who cannot happen to one happens as this

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:55.540
little it's very basic psychological
trick is actually ok I'm getting

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:59.830
overwhelmed because i'm looking at a
five routine which has so far beyond

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:06.430
what I'm capable now in my mind but a
101 I can do and so little ones done all

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:11.000
their stuff is fictional we knew it
doesn't exist that's just my mind's

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.500
worrying like it does going off into
space and future tripping the other

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:20.240
thing is I think that's really important
we talked about why so he made a comment

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:27.440
about them for is when the fear barriers
come up what's gonna get you through

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:31.170
those fear barriers as things like guilt
frustration and anger that's why I

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:34.920
really helps you get through fear not
happiness happiness doesn't give you the

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:40.840
power to get through sheer pleasure
doesn't fear the invades power you need

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:45.310
power to get through fear because fear
is like this strong painful feeling that

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:50.840
you need to be like I'm so passionately
angry about this num willing to feel

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:57.770
that pain like it's worth it so every
time you take that next step 1 revisit

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:02.350
why you're doing this and get a really
touch with you said to help people how

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:08.649
people watch what is it what pain are
you helping people was

00:11:08.649 --> 00:11:14.240
being sick time people are sick all the
time because the food additives that

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:23.759
they're using their not eating I mean it
is literally it is for most people and

00:11:23.759 --> 00:11:32.769
it doesn't have to be so we just that's
all they need to do is change 2013 just

00:11:32.769 --> 00:11:40.079
needs to happen to something here dan
cause I got a little bit of background

00:11:40.079 --> 00:11:50.350
on Teresa's while here so when you look
at how did his described authenticity

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:55.660
invulnerability and how he's come to
what he's doing now of course you could

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:56.749
I do to me

00:11:56.749 --> 00:11:59.899
the group that he started coaching that
he's doing is based out of his own life

00:11:59.899 --> 00:12:05.740
experience while the fact of the matter
is this course that Greece's talking

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:14.550
about here is this is pulled out of
someplace random oh just a minute to a

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:18.679
course on this there's a reason that's
what he's doing is green smoothie course

00:12:18.679 --> 00:12:26.579
here and that's something that I think
also a reason to pull into what she's

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:32.910
doing with the course that she's
creating 13 so why are you doing where

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:39.110
did you come to your knowledge about
green smoothies the knowledge was it was

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:47.329
from the internet I did research and
then I started having a meeting then

00:12:47.329 --> 00:12:52.949
whatever you wanna call it and I
actually realized that I was doing so

00:12:52.949 --> 00:13:00.620
much better routes looking better and
then from there just wanted to do it

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:07.589
pretty much that's what I add that's
what I also I mean I did they had did

00:13:07.589 --> 00:13:12.220
the research on the internet and then I
have followed it up with my own life
