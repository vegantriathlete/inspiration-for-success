00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.460
ok so you started getting some real
hands and practical all experience with

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.140
this is not something that was like the
pickup artist or you're just trying to

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.910
see if you can get a girl you know think
the context

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:34.430
job people who are ostensibly what
you're looking to do is is to actually

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:45.700
help these people you know is not a game
you when it gets and so then how did

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:53.890
things start to change it in your life
you know professionally as you gain more

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:02.340
experience is your studying more aware
of like when you're being manipulated in

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.229
and how to deal with confrontations

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.130
one of the first things particularly out
with my Korea in corrections was that

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.200
when you start asserting itself we start
standing up for what you believe those

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.280
rights and stuffing willing to take
risks of people disapproving you are

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.430
what you start seeing yourself a message
there what you believe that is good for

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.509
you believe in his day you ok so you
start building out self acceptance which

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.970
is a huge factor in confidence and so
what's happening is little things like

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.950
I'm at a team meeting or I'm at a
meeting with some high-ranking people I

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.470
would speak my mind in a situation where
many people would feel you know all risk

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.549
my job if I say the truth I want and
what I learned is particularly in that

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:57.700
example is the people who are really
high up they really value that is so

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.409
hard to find somebody who will give it
to them straight because Iran's just

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.439
trying to like manipulated in order to
serve their Korea as I have someone

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:08.750
actually risked their careers to tell
the truth as something that they can

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.540
trust deeply and they they had a high
level like executive levels

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.790
very hard to trust so I started
realizing that the more honest I was the

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.129
more kind of unbreakable my reputation
became so no matter what even if I

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:30.579
really piss people off there was a lie
well that's what that's day and that's

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:36.109
what you get with Dan and this kind of
acceptance of of you being that way we

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:41.470
can kind of get away with murder in a
few examples like I'm not a huge fan of

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.620
this Russell Brand is an example I use a
lot and I don't agree with a lot of

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:52.409
stuff he says but he is a fantastic
example of shamelessness so he will he

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:58.159
will go to you know talk show and I'll
head on everyone in the house to hit or

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:02.680
whatever females within like 30 meters
over your head on the cameramen and

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.379
because he's always like that it's raw
so you know somebody who's never be like

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.989
that suddenly started doing its weird
and so when I started realizing as

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:19.129
always I was really consistently
demonstrating honesty people just kind

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:23.900
of learned to accept and this is what
allowed me to build up the confidence to

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:31.139
start asking for promotions to start
becoming like an advocate for for people

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:37.500
who don't have a voice and things like
that and that really serve my career

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.879
laws eventually it became like well
who's the guy we can rely on to give it

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:46.220
to us straight and that became like a
key factor for a lot of people deciding

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:53.790
whether or not to promote me and yes oh
so all of this was started with a

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.299
telling off some guy who had broken his
parole conditions that started off the

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:04.790
year ends I think one of the key things
are realized is around shamelessness so

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.479
shame is owned by my definition
attaching the concept of wrong to

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:13.639
something which is true that you so you
take something that you know as you

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:17.680
anything goes wrong or bad for that
thing to be to be true

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.300
shamelessness is about only everything
that's true about you you don't have to

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.650
like it you don't have to enjoy it but
you make sure that it's yours

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:32.090
try to hide it you don't moderated or
make it look pretty just give its people

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.780
like this is me every time you do that
you're seeing yourself a message that

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.139
you're good enough time you don't do
that you see yourself missus that you're

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.180
not good enough so I think of it in
terms of just almost every time I'm

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:52.320
honest in my expression the message I
see myself as I'm good enough away every

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.710
time I'm dishonest missus I see myself
is this part of me is not good enough to

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:02.020
hide it and this is really I think this
is the underlying defect at all

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:07.130
confidence is one of the messages you're
standing itself secretly under the

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.479
messages so when you like oh I can say
that in front of them because you know

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:15.240
they're my boss what you're really
saying is I'm not good enough at all

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.940
you're saying and so when some you know
when I started looking at I realized I

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.349
was doing this site all day every day
just tell myself I'm not good enough

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:27.930
through being dishonest through hiding
the truth about myself so when I start

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.479
changing that causes some very
uncomfortable situations I go through

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:36.250
but I started to feel that self-worth
rise just a you know what

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:46.500
yeah that's out there now so it must be
good enough and so you didn't see you

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.380
got more leadership positions with the
parole system there but that's not what

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.860
you're doing any more because what
you're doing now I was your coaching

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:04.650
all-time in this created what led you to
decide that you wanted to get out of the

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:08.180
system

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:13.560
well i wud at this stage on my book us
20 time with corrections and read my

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.949
book and I realized I wanted to start
doing this in person so I started

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:23.699
coaching these two girls fantastic woman
on the side and I think so I'm going

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:27.889
like 70 hour weeks now sort of coaching
the rioting during my normal full time

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:29.670
job which is pretty demanding

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:36.420
and i'd study is so much coaching those
girls they were transforming their life

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.860
right in front of me even though they
haven't paid a scene you know they don't

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:45.730
need to pay Tobias and and I was asking
so much out of there and yet

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:52.600
corrections as increasingly feel
restricted by the bureaucracy of a

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.890
government agency said the things I
could see you like this is different the

00:06:55.890 --> 00:07:00.410
right thing to do but as always barriers
to me actually doing it and so would hit

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:05.460
the limit of how much I could live by my
values within their job before I just

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:10.420
don't feel like other external factors
were forcing me to sacrifice my values

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:15.550
like I just couldn't have the freedom
the autonomy that I needed a new with

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:22.710
coaching I did and so eventually through
receiving coaching I developed enough

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:30.400
courage to make the leap into full-time
coaching right so let's start talking

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.570
about the app now in something to keep
in mind is that we've been talking about

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:39.310
specifics in dan situation in his life

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:47.310
idea of being the nice guy or the pickup
artist or what he was doing his job with

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:51.530
corrections but if you step back and
take a look at this little bit you can

00:07:51.530 --> 00:08:01.120
see about how there's teams that apply
to you you know other people's lives

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:06.550
other context and whether you're doing
the digital product online or you're on

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:11.510
you to me or other business that you
looking to start a lot of the things

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:18.650
that we are already talked about do high
into a much bigger picture in so right

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:27.340
now we're starting at just two more that
kind of the specific ways that these

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:39.440
tight in August too much just the things
that dance talking about because now

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.039
they are talking about so you should
have a much

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:50.970
closer ties to you know everybody who's
taking a look at this rate know so dance

00:08:50.970 --> 00:09:01.769
coach he's gonna make that leap in go
into coaching full-time it mentioned he

00:09:01.769 --> 00:09:12.800
was doing some coaching on the side and
he hadn't been in the lead to do so in

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.819
things like a victim mentality you
mentioned things about taking

00:09:16.819 --> 00:09:18.509
responsibility for yourself

00:09:18.509 --> 00:09:24.360
pulling some of those pieces together
here is almost 20 minutes till the hour

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:28.000
I do want to give a chance to open the
seeds for people at some point of the

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.940
onus is on you get a chance to get free
coaching hear from Dan some lightning

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:46.839
coach so when you were here how you
approach things you know your mindset

00:09:46.839 --> 00:09:54.440
about 80 take responsibility for
yourself being authentic in it together

00:09:54.440 --> 00:10:00.670
some of the things that we've been
talking about previously in yes I mean

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:06.120
finding the courage to make the leap I
mean I had at that point I had started

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:10.579
getting some paying clients but nowhere
near enough to be sure that I could do

00:10:10.579 --> 00:10:17.850
this so the decision you know ages it
was about me thinking how do I do it but

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:24.329
this is why why should I do it and you
know simon Sinek the thought leader on

00:10:24.329 --> 00:10:28.990
leadership he's a great guy to look up
on TV and stuff like that but this kind

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:33.540
of thing but you know what he's saying
is it's all about the Y and that's where

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:39.300
authenticity comes in all the enthusiasm
how what that's why that's the reason

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:45.480
the motive behind your behavior the
value driven motive and so became

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:50.660
terms of everything I do and business
it's always why am I doing this what is

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:56.019
the reason for its rather than how
should I do it or what should I do

00:10:56.019 --> 00:11:01.829
and this is who I think we talked about
this a little while ago

00:11:01.829 --> 00:11:07.779
you know there's let's say you know me
courses they're yummy courses where so

00:11:07.779 --> 00:11:12.959
obviously the person's life passion
comes through areas so kept at bay in to

00:11:12.959 --> 00:11:16.459
watch them talk about it and to be part
of the course because you're like man

00:11:16.459 --> 00:11:21.610
this person loves this shit like this is
they made this course because it was the

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:24.920
right thing to do not because they're
just trying to squeeze some money idea

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:29.610
was like there's a big difference like
we all have a different purpose of

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:36.480
reason and there's some of their just
like a so what's selling right now I'll

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:40.089
do a course on that and they don't care
about the content that I care about the

00:11:40.089 --> 00:11:44.269
quality of care about the experience
that the user has just like how do I

00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:50.829
squeeze money out some wallets and you
know in the longer term that's that's

00:11:50.829 --> 00:11:55.269
doing that approach because eventually
there's just there's no passion of

00:11:55.269 --> 00:11:59.559
there's not enough of their motivation
to keep going you don't feel it doesn't

00:11:59.559 --> 00:12:04.339
have enough to wanted to i mean the
reason I do what I do is because it

00:12:04.339 --> 00:12:10.029
hurts me to see a nice guys and people
please cause I feel their pain watching

00:12:10.029 --> 00:12:22.420
among going sucks being that way and
destroying my drives me and this is the

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:26.420
underlying factor to all of this when we
talk about what's interesting is the

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:31.970
reason you're doing it so compelling to
you that you diet you have to try and

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:35.240
get it done you'll spend the rest of
your life trying to make it happen

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:41.220
because it's so important I kind of got
a little out of track about the question

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:46.019
I think but this is really what's been
underlying at least all the best moves

00:12:46.019 --> 00:12:48.439
are made of business now

00:12:48.439 --> 00:12:53.009
underlying all the worst moves of main
business is the house on the water so

00:12:53.009 --> 00:12:57.439
soon as I get stuck on how sure how can
I make more money that's when I start

00:12:57.439 --> 00:13:02.049
going off track when I get stuck on
what's the right way to do this that's

00:13:02.049 --> 00:13:05.929
when I start getting off track that's
what I stopped making sure to the air

00:13:05.929 --> 00:13:08.620
base decisions I made a bunch of those
this year

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:14.760
I sent an email out to my community how
i fucked up 2015

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:21.910
got lost I got I got off track and I got
lost in the house and the what and I

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:26.710
magnin short-term decisions which have
long-term consequences but we know that

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:32.370
when I whenever I make his passion base
decisions they caught up in painful in

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:36.750
the short term there's some discomfort
I'll have to face but the long-term so

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:41.360
much more rewarding like the discomfort
of having to invest in and making a

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:46.060
yummy course you know that kind of time
and energy and the fear of people seeing

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:52.480
your ideas and knowing the real you that
that they'd have somebody go through the

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.920
course again holy shit this is changed
the way I do everything that's the

00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:00.860
reward you get you know like I said I
lost track of the question completely

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:06.210
but really getting in touch with why
