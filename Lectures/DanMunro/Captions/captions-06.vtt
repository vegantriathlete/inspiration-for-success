00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.940
right in there so that's what I'm
getting at here is not that literally

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.809
where did you find out about how to make
a green smoothie but what's your life

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.719
experience with green smoothies and
there's never any clue about your life

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.830
straight to the green smoothies but I do
though let them know what your life

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.100
experiences with the green smoothies my
life experiences in the last two years I

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.580
have been in the Marines made it almost
every day and actually I go for a couple

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.730
of days without them I don't feel very
well I know that they make a difference

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.370
and I know that people get healthier I
didn't even start losing weight till

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:46.350
about five months ago and I'm not 66
tell me it that's are getting here so in

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:54.949
five months or so she's lost like sixty
pounds were interested entries is

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:08.010
particularly before the green smoothies
what pain were you when I was sick and

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:16.860
depressed extremely different hats
bearing that is that's kind of nice and

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:25.360
it didn't help when 1996 I was in the
Army and then I went to school and i got

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:37.680
a job so I never had any time you know
that that's all part of what I one share

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:47.439
this this is what's gonna get you past
the via is not only your pain and that

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.030
there were you've been through but the
fact that you found something that

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.130
helped and so when you're against a
point like a small enough to fit my

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.909
course on I want you to go hey who is
gonna miss out because i dont put this

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.950
course on and what are they gonna
missile 2010 out there is suffering how

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.899
are they suffering and how will they
keep suffering if they don't get my

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.120
course

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:22.099
so you know they're suffering yeah I did
I did so it comes down to this is our

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:27.680
song gatien they like my fear about
should I should I say my ideas or not I

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.670
think what about their nice guy out
there who feels like isolated from

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.180
everybody else feels like he's the only
person on the planet and worries that

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.470
he's a psychopath because you can't feel
any emotion when I'm at home as a feared

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.629
a home that I hope back to main so when
you think about what about those people

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:50.420
out there who were unable to process
deep grief properly so they started

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.109
eating badly entry themselves barely and
they got sick and they got their

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:58.590
self-worth and the self-image went down
one of those people gonna miss out on if

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:06.670
you don't do your course very good I
like that I never thought I mean I know

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.799
that I'm doing it to help them but I
never thought about what they would be

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.659
losing if i dont

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:21.519
other people I yeah look at how much
were you able to put in the course then

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:28.180
because the transformed the course for
you this isn't just about green

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.160
smoothies in Europe green smoothies when
you're willing to put your cell in your

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:44.129
story in course so people can see about
how I've been talking today and here

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:52.169
today about his coaching in being a nice
guy or pick up artist type of approach

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:57.359
but I mentioned to people when we write
about 30 or 35 after take some of the

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:01.250
things we're talking about and see how
those concepts become part of your life

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:08.530
is the same ok sure this course you
might be teaching people about green

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:15.090
smoothies but that's not really why
you're making course it's what you were

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:21.170
able to do what you started putting
these greens with you lost weight in

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.780
part of a larger process that you've
been going through here with dealing

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.740
with grief and anxiety in it all of
these other things and that's not to say

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.770
that green smoothies are going to be the
miracle plot in the pixie dust that

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.750
people just sprinkle over and we were
themselves to get rid of depression and

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:45.720
anxiety increase in their life but
people who maybe aren't at all

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:52.620
interested in green smoothies may still
be very interested in your course when

00:04:52.620 --> 00:05:00.310
they see how that transformation for
yourself by improving your diet by

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:07.870
taking concrete action soon become so
much bigger than just a minute teach you

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.810
how to make green smoothies in years a
bunch of green smoothies or if you eat

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:18.680
these green smoothies maybe you're gonna
lose some weight is well of course gets

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:26.870
to take on a much bigger impact that i'm
gonna watch my journey of how I dealt

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:35.690
with grief and anxiety in these other
bigger issues that's that's the point of

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.110
being a man and somebody's not gonna
sign up the course how to make green

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.940
smoothies but they will sign up to the
course how do you find your own way to

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.310
deal with the grief they're held you
back that's what they're going to align

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.790
with that's where they're gonna hear
your story and I really hope it's not

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:55.000
already your story as throughout the
course that isn't just put this in a

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.530
blender it's the reason I do ask is
because when my son passed away I didn't

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:06.940
have the tools to deal with it you know
my my health got there by myself and

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:11.520
declined because of their and I realized
that the way to break through this was

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.990
stopped with my my health

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.620
you know for me to get to a place where
I'm gonna be in the right mindset to

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:22.360
deal with the pain then on then I need
to get right I need to be functioning

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.480
you know I'm just making this up once
you've got your own story but yeah I

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.500
think my camera put a bit of this is a
course on green smoothies and then

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.680
there's the course on learning how to me

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.180
as your health so he can deal with the
pain that you're right that's the

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:42.199
court's people gonna be like that Smith
finally very few people like how do you

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:45.199
make a smoothie that's you know this
YouTube video so that that's not what

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:57.289
you courses about you know you're very
good so I hope that being able to frame

00:06:57.289 --> 00:07:05.030
in that fashion gives you that kind of
debt doesn't have to be a girl but

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:11.120
intense type of emotion that you can
have no way to get it I don't need to

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:16.460
finish this course so that people could
learn how to make a green smoothie I

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:22.699
need to finish this course so that
people can get this bigger impact about

00:07:22.699 --> 00:07:29.669
transforming their life in a way to deal
with some of these these bigger issues

00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:36.199
and so will you start having any of
these type of desires to procrastinate

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:45.560
make excuses for whatever reason you
can't shoot that next video look at that

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:51.050
