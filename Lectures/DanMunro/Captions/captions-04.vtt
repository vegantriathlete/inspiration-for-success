00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.290
and so it is to help you out here with
some of the aspects of the questions so

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:13.070
you'd gone into full-time coaching in
you do need to be able to acquire

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.690
clients and get some paying clients but
that doesn't necessarily happen right

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.740
away right so talk to people about you
when we had our prep session came up

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:31.140
this idea about like your culminating in
you talked about that even in the sense

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:40.450
of being a victim for yourself so a
little bit about that idea of how you

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:47.370
take responsibility in your concept of
cultivating the cultivating a garden in

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.280
how this helps you in in building your
business

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.590
it with your building it right yeah I
mean we can use it to me quite a while

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.559
to talk about this because I'll see the
suspension the yummy Facebook group

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.290
people say have posted my course why
isn't selling and what I'm saying

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.590
straight away in my mind is like well
what marketing you doing how are you

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.100
selling it does it doesn't sell itself
what did you think was going to happen

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.920
but then I realized cause you know this
is their victim versus responsibility

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.670
mindset so when we look at a victim was
saying that the world should give it to

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.159
me that as always I'm goods deserve to
get things or the world's not gonna give

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.640
to me because I'm a terrible person
either way it's just kind of sitting

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.380
back passively waiting for sure to have
somebody take responsibility goes you

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.320
know it's my job to get this done and
responsibility is not the same as taking

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.770
the blame blame is like a real shame
basting like things go wrong it's my

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.040
fault that's not taking responsibility
responsibility is going to go wrong it's

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.899
my job to deal with things go wrong it's
my job to do something I'm not going to

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:00.509
sit and wait for somebody else to do the
job I'm gonna get into it it's so if we

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.930
apply this to you to me like when I saw
the kind of unique concept I thought sky

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.689
called that they do promotion for you
and stuff

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:11.400
well the whole time as soon as I put my
program to get them thinking I'm the one

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.600
is going to launch this new one is good

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.970
to sell it on the one is going to
promote I'm gonna get out there and get

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.550
uncomfortable and tell people about the
program and have people say no all that

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.720
kind of stuff and I mean animal practice
and that's one of the reasons I turned

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.920
off the promotions is dads now you
dummies promotions special that Black

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.780
Friday 10 just like giving away free
sort of thing and I now this release are

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.110
not cool with me and I realize now I'm I
don't want them to do it for me I want

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.520
to do it myself you know I love the
platform as they can you know they like

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.290
to talk to I'm really happy for ciliates
and stuff i dead I love that means more

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:58.250
people get the message I just don't
wanna being thrown around and devalued

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.010
because of that you know I want people
understands that what they getting as as

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.560
well as something and I want to have
this high standard for myself and that's

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.110
taken responsibility and that means that
short-term pain so somebody putting a

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.620
course on you know me that well I just
tried the course post up there now do

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.080
nothing else and just wait for the money
to roller that's a really pass of the

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.800
minds it approached this you gonna have
to keep your hands duty if you want to

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.660
really happen you don't have to go out
there and generate an audience you gonna

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.680
have to go out there and approach people
one is it time stuff though not the

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.030
community and you gonna have to provide
values those people for free without

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.460
expectation over to just because it's
the right thing to do you know these are

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:45.600
the concepts of business that I really
wish I had been taught at the stop but

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.630
now you know you can handle it when you
learned it does this is huge for me in

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.820
when we talk about growing a garden is
realizing that my community is going to

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:02.340
be made up of people who I have provided
value to that's so people are going to

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.600
want more of me because what I've given
them as valuable to them and so it's

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.410
like planting seeds you know I find
people to give value to find a way to

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.380
give them value and then I just keep
doing that and more seats get planted

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.780
now the people who align well with what
I'm doing the people with the same

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.440
values as me they applaud you know they
grow they they will reciprocate

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.860
reciprocate by

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.729
buying products or promoting the or just
giving me good feedback or just even

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:37.060
participating in what I do which I find
really rewarding and so the gun stuff to

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.409
grow sell some people do not really
blossom they stand out and those are the

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:45.259
people who get the most of my attention
you know those are my high-value clients

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:49.840
as the people I take the best care off
and forgive my you know my most of my

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.960
energy and I don't I don't spend time on
seeds in heaven ground Utah I just keep

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:04.610
looking for higher quality people to
bring into the garden so ya know when

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:16.379
your people to give more attention who
so if if this she doesn't Germany right

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:16.870
away

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.889
does that mean that you just discarded
and you say well that's just the Dead

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:25.500
Sea want someone to my community I take
care of them whether they want me to not

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:31.680
like I get to the point where I wanted
to tell me to go away you know I had

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.190
this is actually a coach of a coach
doesn't matter guy Steve channel Olson

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:41.430
coach and somebody is asking hey when do
you stop trying to seem somebody value

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.860
and he got a piece of paper in his
writing on Friday he held it up and it

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.800
said restraining order he said when you
see one of these that's when you start

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:55.740
and end up those are great examples like
all seen someone value until they tell

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.409
me to go away that's when I know they're
really not a good fit for me and I

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:03.699
learned this because there are some
people I'm coaching right now so the

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:08.699
high-value clients of mine I met them
over a year and a half two years ago and

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:13.300
I've been silent the entire time just
watching me from the background reading

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.400
my emails read my blog post watching my
videos

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:22.969
secretly trying to build up the courage
or the responsibility mind frame to

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:26.770
reach out to me and when they do you
know by the time they do the border

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.089
receive so much value from me that
there's no convincing or selling I have

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:35.800
to do they just already you know they're
already dubbing per my community this

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.790
whole time and they appreciate that I
didn't give up

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:45.780
you know there are others who might make
a lot of noise nursing a drain on you

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.150
you know that's a different story
against this somebody's taking up a lot

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:53.510
of time and energy and that that's a
plan that's like a weed it's kind of a

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:56.980
big thing you god I'm not saying that
these are bad people are saying the

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:01.620
wrong shit for your community you know
and identifying those and kind of

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:06.800
pushing them so likely save somebody's
trying to get a lot of sort of free

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.540
support by email right so the cinema
lots and lots of questions and stuff

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:15.290
they're not really reciprocating any of
the value that is trying to take as much

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:17.680
from me as possible

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:23.240
them to take actions now push them to
invest in themselves or invest in

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:30.040
something and when I don't do it I get
this warning sign like actually maybe

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.460
they're not right

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:36.830
alright for me and I'll start by sending
off the kind of energy that I'm giving

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:42.770
to all part of just maintain their
garden but the ability to lit seeds grow

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:48.110
in their own time by just constantly
watering and fertilizing them taking

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:52.200
good care of the plants have grown and
focusing on your energy on those and

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.140
then occasionally having to wait this
place
