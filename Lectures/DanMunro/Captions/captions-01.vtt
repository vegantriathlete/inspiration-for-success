this secret so that they can get the
most out of their short time this planet

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:15.500
so then tell us a little bit about what
your life was like before you started on

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:26.980
the cool it goes through the roof right
now

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:34.209
yeah I think like we talked about
earlier this week I think nice guy is

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:40.489
the best way to categorize the way I was
living and socially at the pool of

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.730
people please eat something that starts
in early childhood many people are

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.820
affected by it to me it was just a
misunderstanding so some key elements

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:55.739
that occurred when I was younger and
thinking that I need to constantly be

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.430
seeking the approval of others that
there was the ultimate height of living

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:06.299
was have people like you and to be
approved off and this ended up

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:12.049
determining the way I lived my entire
life and I kind of safety approach that

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:17.810
I took to being in social interactions
where I would perform the people there's

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.289
a lot of different ways that this people
pleasing comes out some people just hide

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:24.010
in the background so they don't up CD
new one

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.860
and other people they they develop a
persona often thousands of different

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:34.490
personas four different individuals and
as one of those is a comedian hiding in

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:40.460
plain sight so I would perform before
more the time particularly for people I

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:47.720
felt intimidated by or people who like
deemed as higher status than myself and

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:55.950
stay in I wouldn't yeah I basically just
my behavior that the things I revealed

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.910
everything all the time steep adjusting
it to make sure just what people wanted

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.180
manipulating them so that they stayed
and heightened mood around me that

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.800
something was sad or angry upset I learn
the skills to manipulate them into being

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.190
happy you know and which is also may
cause I don't tell myself that at the

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.630
time I'm a good person on this site

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:24.280
they've gone for people like me it's
just people pleasing but yeah I had the

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:32.140
age of about 24 25 and at some point
just win you know this is not working

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:38.080
this is Moshe this whole way of living
is pretty much just painful and all the

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.190
things that I'm supposed to be getting
from being nice and not happening I'm

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:47.080
not getting love and connection like I
want my career as a going away i won

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.330
and seems like the universe is not
rewarding me for being nice that's

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:57.780
really unfair and so I started looking
making some changes and I think it

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.250
really we talked about this a really big
gun for me with the whole pick up artist

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:06.980
movements this you know this learning
how to manipulate woman into liking it

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:14.290
so I go worse before I got better much
much worse I became a huge manipulation

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:18.730
skills I now learned how to be the
master of all people places and has

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:25.730
since and but what the stormy was that I
can change if I want to I can learn new

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:32.040
behaviors I can address fear I don't
have to just lived the kind of had been

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.940
dealt I can make some decisions for
myself and

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:42.000
you know long story short I discovered
the beauty that comes from being honest

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.580
this kind of way of living where you
allow people to dislike you that's gonna

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:50.520
be the case you allow people to be
polarized away from you in order to

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:57.350
express yourself as truthfully as
accurately as possible and after many

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:01.330
years of slowly delving into this more
and more and finding that kind of

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:06.850
connection and rewards that come from
being this way I started reverse

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:10.800
engineering how does this happen and
that's where we came up with the three X

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:16.500
model and you know that's why we're here
today right but before we jump into the

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.710
model and some of the other big stuff
that you have to share I don't want to

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:26.150
gloss over the whole artists that you
went through you and you said that you

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:31.980
did learn from that the upside of it the
positive it positive was that you did

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:37.380
learn that you can change your behavior

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:45.010
talking a little bit you mentioned is
when we were talking in our prep session

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:50.100
but there's a couple of different
schools of the pickup artist methodology

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:55.300
you are using one of them also talked to
me about how and when you were doing

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:59.800
this pickup artist things that you had a
sense that you were being honest in your

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:04.460
being authentic so talk a little bit
more of the pickup artist schools that

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:09.090
the one that you were using it how he
went about practicing some of the pickup

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:13.470
artist skills that made you feel like
you are making progress at the time even

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:17.920
though now you're able to tell us you
got worse not better

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:22.110
yes there was when it first came out
there's a book called the game by Neil

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:28.460
Strauss and it's it's a fun book to read
and I took their book very seriously you

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:32.930
know this book heads step-by-step
instructions in terms of how to make

00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:38.640
someone attracted to you and the there
was a branch of all these different

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:42.840
schools but all of them had one thing in
common and that is avoid rejection to

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:48.890
use psychological tactics to trigger
kind of unconscious things and somebody

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:52.810
else to basically manipulate them from
such a callable that they have no choice

00:08:52.810 --> 00:09:00.740
in the matter and it's it's through this
kind of indirect false I don't know what

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:04.760
you'd call it like routine so I'm going
to talk to someone I had the whole like

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:09.460
first 20 to 30 minutes of conversation
already planned I know exactly what I'm

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:15.500
gonna do I know how to react to the in
to keep it on track and so on so this

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:19.460
this allowed me to actually just get
into conversations that I hadn't had

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:22.900
before in my life that allowed those
little bits of good stuff that was

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:28.300
happening there that I mean for started
Linds I learned how to initiate a

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:32.860
conversation with a complete stranger in
any situation that's a really valuable

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:37.790
skill that I still used today I learned
there's there are a lot of rules that I

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:41.700
thought existed that dimes like just
because somebody looks like they were

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:45.520
the boyfriend order on the phone that
doesn't mean you can't talk to them you

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:48.680
know it just goes on in a big group in
your by yourself doesn't mean you can't

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:49.740
go and talk to their group

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:53.610
a little these rules that could be
broken but after a while I was kind of

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:58.690
like I was getting good at it that was a
problem and are starting to feel kinda

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:04.630
disgusting about myself so I was going
against my values I remember being this

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:09.490
was basically just gaming her as it's
called throughout the whole night

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:13.860
teasing and using all the psych
strategic stuff and i ended up going

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:19.030
home with it and once I got home with I
realized this is wrong

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:23.750
like she doesn't actually have a clue
who I am so hurt us sleep with me now

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:28.360
would be totally non-consensual it's
something very not right about this i

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:32.690
really miss me up and I didn't sleep at
night because of it as I how to sleep on

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:38.120
the floor like I'm having a meltdown
right now it's off to the right on the

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:44.950
other style of pickup of being two rigs
which is where you actually

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:49.150
straightforward about your intentions is
none of the strategic manipulation

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:54.090
anymore it's kind of like I'm here to
talk to you because of these reasons and

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:59.410
those of the accurate reasons and again
there was still strategy and this this

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:03.200
to like trying to make an outcome happen
but it was so much more open and honest

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:09.060
and straightforward and when I saw was
the power of doing this so to go up to

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:16.490
someone and be like to share with them
held over feat did you take the risk

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:21.530
that they will disapprove that it can
really make someone's day the first time

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:25.840
I did it I think I can picture the whole
thing in my head because I've been I've

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:29.580
been building up to doing this for three
months I've been going to a shopping

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:32.790
mall like I'm just gonna be directed
skimpy tour dates and not the only thing

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:38.810
and finally finally found the balls to
do it messed up the skill and just

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:42.760
seemed like I wanted to stop you because
I thought you are gorgeous and you know

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:49.020
how bad I didn't say hi and she just lit
up and this this light bulb went off

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:53.300
inside my head I'm like wow I can make
someone's day just by telling them how I

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:58.600
feel about you know and that was the
beginning and then eventually over time

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.870
but I realized as even though I was
doing that

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:05.110
still had a strategy attached to it
still had an outcome a test us trying to

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:09.610
get the girl and that's when I really
started to leak goals then still trying

00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:14.800
to get somebody or get something I focus
so much more now on the experience

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:20.850
itself and using truth polarize to push
away things that are bad for me and to

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:25.339
attract things that are good for me was
cut its kinda if it let's just be honest

00:12:25.339 --> 00:12:26.960
all the time in the world

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:30.870
adjusts itself around you is still
before being dishonest or time which

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:32.180
means I just as myself who
