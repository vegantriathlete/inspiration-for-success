Dan Munro is a Confidence Coach based out of Auckland, New Zealand. He created the Brojo men's mastermind group which is growing every day, and is the #1 bestselling author of The Legendary Life.

Dan specializes in helping people figure out what it means to "just be yourself", through helping them remove the psychological barriers to authentic living. He comes from a psychology and science focused philosophy and background, and is expertly trained in motivational techniques, psychological confidence, leadership skills, acceptance and value-based living, and managing manipulation.

Dan is a former People-Pleaser who spent most of his life trying to make other people approve of him. Once he discovered that this was a painful way to live, he set out to find the truth about how to enjoy life, find purpose, and be ultimately satisfied with who you are as a person. He found a pattern, which he calls The 3X Model, that underlies success in all areas of life, and can be learned quickly and effectively.

Dan's mission in life is to teach people this secret so that they can get the most out of their short time on this planet.
