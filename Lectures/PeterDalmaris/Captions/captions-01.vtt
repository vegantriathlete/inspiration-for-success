in information systems mostly reading on

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.409

fun than it sounds

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.140

lecturer teaching a variety of

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.770

Raspberry Pi element and his latest

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:50.770

publishes his courses so welcome to the

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:57.759
weekly is Peter once you tell us a
little bit about your background is

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:05.280
university lecturer writer ok good place
to start

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:22.310
so close to twenty years so I started in
electrical engineering there was heavy

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.540
at the green and I decided to just five
years is not enough then I decided each

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.920
day after that in a way got stuck into
the system by the time I was done with

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:43.940
that it was it was too late to do
anything else have been a university and

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:53.120
academic approach and then using my
skills in the industry so that much how

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.400
it all happened to me and it was it was
this way that I over the issue develop

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:06.010
my skills as an instructor and a lecture
and the teacher was dealing with photo

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:16.640
much your students didn't show Mom 18
2010 so so yeah that the total started

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:26.700
ok and what types of subjects were you
teaching at the University

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:38.130
technologies after I came to Australia I
got into the soil show my undergraduate

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.220
days which they do hardware switch into
software so I've been teaching in

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.590
emission technology and information
systems subject to the kind of subject

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.320
to manage you want to become a web
developer network and things like that

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.910
computer engineer even sometimes but
somehow and that probably is because I

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:05.700
was in the chest employees such a long
time I also moved into management and

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:11.630
innovation subjects so far few years
actually teaching innovation and

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.750
technology management in one of the
major universities here

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:20.630
one that was actually a subject that I
just so wheres I was helping students

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.330
are possible client problems in the
industry actually not so much into

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.510
should but everyday lives in middle
annoying problems in then correct I

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:42.820
stand correct based solution to your
problem it was fun and so you said that

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:50.340
you were teaching technologies subjects
and so you know as I'm sure people are

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:59.330
familiar technology can change very
rapidly oh yeah and so how did things go

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.610
for you in your classes trying to keep
up with teaching your students to use

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:14.330
technology subjects most challenging as
people might think universities unknown

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:22.240
universal shouldn't say all of them but
majority negotiation i get very

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.830
comfortable teaching the same thing

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:30.490
10 years 15 years until somebody largest
at the technology with pitching is not

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.950
available anymore she was can download
it to come by cd4 occur in the book

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:41.720
anymore so it's time to get our cautious
so it wasn't very challenging in bed was

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:51.130
a major problem after you take the same
thing to reform our times he kept secret

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:56.229
so that's that's when I started looking
elsewhere

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:05.630
actually yield courses that I thought
were arraigned event today and it's five

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.930
starts capping it is possible

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.240
yeah and how are things like how did you
feel things worked up here students

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:20.190
you're trying to teach technology in you
know in the University Senate yeah look

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:25.490
ahead a mix of students many students
did not remind course they were nervous

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.350
system

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:32.020
get a degree and then get a job later so
they just do whatever we are still

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:39.300
doesn't sound very nice but yeah that's
how our days but I had students that are

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:44.570
you there were actually getting bored
and unchallenged and they were talking

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:50.490
about how these debates that you are
asking us to use and have no choice i

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:55.520
can download it and handed the
commission to find the line is revision3

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.970
and you're asking us to do vision 1.2

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:07.440
understand but you know we've got five
campuses and everybody has to do the

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:14.840
same thing and unfortunately besides
that this Richmond VA just just bear

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:28.980
with us get through these can be free
but then you miss from my other writings

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:33.590
outside the university is to publish
blokes and had it all

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:42.100
channel four get I mean and they knew
that are worse into cutting edge then

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:48.360
like a delicious think about 2008 2009
even before that some seven into

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:54.270
smartphone application development so is
bill because she's so awesome I was

00:07:54.270 --> 00:08:00.250
interviewing Rao's when been reinforced
in version 1.5 so much that they would

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:07.840
come to me to consult and not for
assignments and exams for things that

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:15.660
were more close to the real interests in
the real things that they want to be

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:21.900
doing so that again gave me the
incentive to look a little bit deeper

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:27.800
into this and see whether I can do more
of this for more of my time instead of

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:28.490
just break
