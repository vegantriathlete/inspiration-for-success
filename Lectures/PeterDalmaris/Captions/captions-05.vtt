00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.319
ok so I that's one thing that I like to
see as maybe kind of wrap up our parent

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.480
with cos I do want to get a chance to
open as a little bit here if you want to

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.740
be able to ask your own questions that
they want to jump in and take a seat so

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:23.560
you're talking about trying some things
out you know learning some different

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.849
things in Romania top of this there was
one of the things that we had discussed

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:35.380
a little bit is one of the motivations
that you have continuing to do well as

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:43.489
the fact that you are getting to learn
some new things so it's not just about

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:51.070
the courses in making money online
courses but your ability to continue to

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:57.510
learn if you could talk a little bit
about what are some of the types of

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.850
things you're learning and you know how
that gives you a bit you know a return

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.299
on your investment

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:16.200
yes I am Not sure if you're talking
about learning as a student or learning

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:23.590
skills relating to teaching you to me is
that what you meant is just are taking

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:31.000
other classes in the course of producing
your classes at one of the benefit is

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.250
that you get to learn new things new
skills that you're picking up in the

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:44.810
course of producing okay good great yeah
so look out almost anything that up and

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.240
take it back

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:54.509
doesn't sound it's not right many of the
things that we're thanks to mistakes

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.979
that I made in my course which kind
enough to be the most successful one as

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.890
well but that's a different story but I
make a lot of mistakes but of course so

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:13.400
because my decision to try out and she

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:20.780
had ghost that mean Startup methodology
I didn't quite get great will so I

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:27.849
planned for three sections were taken a
public stand that then caught eight this

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:33.870
works I just adding stuff you know this
topic will attend that the package as

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.379
well and somebody ask that you put that
in there too so I ended up having a

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:44.430
massive course with no structure in it
difficult for people to to find things

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.269
around another state that I did an
example wish that every one of the

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:57.480
lectures was tagged on the screen with
that let Chen rumba and that made it

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:05.720
very hard to rearrange rounding up to
improve the structure I had problems

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:13.629
with this I made quizzes that
complicated but sometimes you know like

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:20.989
may have been in a hurry to finish up we
can go ahead and ask a stupid question

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:26.540
and just because that's right let's go
back and fix that

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:38.870
so again never compromise the quality of
your content of external constraints be

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.409
careful about that in terms of support

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:49.150
lessons to be learned was that really
there is no limit

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:59.180
tell my students that my priorities and
the screen my courses is number one

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:06.090
fixings takes shape somebody says that
hate such an era and I drop everything

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:16.299
I'm doing a matter what it is everything
and fix the mistakes and then an hour

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:21.820
later that way I can go back to the same
students thanks fixed

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:29.140
my number two priority is you don't
support that I've been lucky so far

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:34.060
because having been in you take it as I
thought initially initially that I would

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.310
have scored about 16,000 students and I
thought to contribute to unsafe we

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.050
should be no but they don't generate as
much as I thought knowing that they

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.630
usually ask me questions so I spent a
lot of time supporting them through the

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:54.890
forums and no-show reusing most of the
Material or reproduce

00:04:54.890 --> 00:05:01.950
answering questions for my email
automation system and for my blog posts

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:07.540
she got 26 by dot com you'll see that
I've got a blog there and much of the

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:15.590
continent that block come strong
alliances to my you to meet students so

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:23.010
I read use a lot of the content they
produce so last night just got back to

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:28.730
the most recent example somebody asked
me some notice a really good question

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:36.410
spent about an hour and a half to
research it and respond and ensure that

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:43.620
I get a c-section copy paste a blog post
add I'll be posting some come on over

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:51.380
the weekend have become my nation so I
think these two heading and a strategy

00:05:51.380 --> 00:06:01.440
for your online teaching aids came out
of the mistakes that I did early on what

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:08.430
else so we'll see how the most technical
aspects of producing courses like what

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.480
tools you use I made a lot of mistakes
along the way that the parties and the

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:19.220
tools that are used all the time most of
them were fixed the lives of using now

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:25.990
one of my latest additions nothing make
me look look at other than that way that

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:41.200
I used to look at the past which was
like this

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:50.560
interested probably will
