00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.299
sure we get into that so let me this
recap some of the points for the

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:12.820
listeners that pretty much you have been
able to replace your university in with

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:20.140
your YouTube been able to bring it to a
point that you don't need you have your

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:37.840
time and you did mention that there who
want to buy your other courses things

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:47.430
can go pretty well and so you're kind of
implicit stating to people that you have

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.789
students who are interested in buying
and that's part of your strategies to be

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:00.989
able to replace university so so I'd
like to talk about those couple of

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:09.780
things one is that what are you doing
that is the game your students who like

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.729
their courses in that they purchase your
new courses and then I would like you to

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:22.210
answer is is that pretty much means
right now is just for your marketing

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.900
efforts is just really selling to your
existing any other marketing efforts to

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.509
the next so how do you get your students
to like your courses enough that they're

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:40.460
purchasing more courses from you in are
you selling your yeah that's a good

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:48.409
question so focused on to you to meet
for a couple of minutes and then I'll

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:56.479
talk about what else am I doing so we
can you tell me where I learned how to

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.860
teach online I'm just saying that
everything I'm still learning but myself

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:10.360
now 22 years ago that's not embarrassing
the difference is huge I found that

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.890
students will respond well

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:23.900
its they see value in that the board as
you know indeed any image by anything

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:33.300
for $10 if the student it saves value of
$200 in a course that they bought for

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.570
ten dollars they will be extremely happy
so that's a very good stuff with my

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:45.410
first course there is no step-by-step
Sep 22 our coast guard the hundred and

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:54.170
ten elections but again nobody ever
complete said things so that that it

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:05.660
shows in my statistics class I also I
get hard repository with all the croats

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.959
and nobody ever has to type anything
just going to get the code from a code

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:17.470
repository that's a great help keep the
repository and the courses today then

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.630
exceed them whenever somebody trying to
bug is what I did this morning she and

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:30.489
the course is always up to date the
forums have been lively as well spend a

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.959
couple of hours should be day helping
our students with the questions

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:43.470
sometimes just questions just a marital
have a look at this very quick by some

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.850
of the times like last night I had to
spend an hour and a half researching a

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.060
particular topic that I had counted in
one of the pictures but didn't have

00:03:52.060 --> 00:04:01.410
details I didn't think bob did so the
couch their gap so all that bad do you

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:08.030
to me it's it's a walled gardens like
the Apple ecosystem so everything that I

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:16.109
do inside you to meet tends to stay
inside of you to me sometimes treat my

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:25.130
course that doesn't happen when you're
so picks up on that you let me ask you

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.000
know

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.990
pick up on how many questions you want
answered how often do you update your

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:41.150
questions you sign up all these things
become statistics for them and they

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.920
support instructors that they can see
the course of potential that over the

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:54.710
long term and that say I give you an
example when get pics that are they put

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:02.650
a little in marketing base coaches so
thing Jackie Jackie asked me a question

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:11.500
about whether you to me advertisers my
courses and they do I was doing a google

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:17.310
search on my courses the other day and
the latest one that I'm going just like

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:23.630
it like a pro when a typed into Google
kike of course this one it came up the

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:24.419
stairs

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:29.990
management that came up was you then
meets at that is meant with a link to my

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.740
course on you to me so I couldn't
believe my ass and not tried some of me

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.710
about some of my other courses as well
and seems like they do that consistently

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:46.220
achieves full BS and more asleep I
course so they spent a lot of money

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.700
course same thing happens with Facebook

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:55.530
very often when I get my facebook status
try see my own causes advertised by you

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:03.419
turn me on Facebook and I tried a little
that myself I tried various mensch tried

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:07.600
Facebook we don't they don't really work

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:15.830
patient autonomy yet I believes that the
reason that adds like that to me because

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.020
of precipitation and just that song
apparel that they have to have those

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:29.160
hedge trimming costs I did my thing they
need but Google

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:37.400
just tests gets consumed thirty minutes
later that same kind of any more usable

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.180
just been talking

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:46.090
$100,000 so that is amazing to me that's
why you to meet number one and I get it

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:51.440
from our CEO and founder from other
platforms that are up-and-coming asking

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.919
me to get my cautious on them and I have
no problem with that but i just adding

00:06:55.919 --> 00:07:03.139
that it's it's impossible to understand
kind of support to students in more than

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:09.509
maybe 12 platforms boy just not feasible
for one person to do that so I had to

00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:14.470
decline in most cases now the second
part of your question what else am I

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:26.229
doing a lot of searching and planning
and work I finally set up a white label

00:07:26.229 --> 00:07:33.259
online school based on these two door up
which is now called teachable and called

00:07:33.259 --> 00:07:39.590
the Explorer thought they just said
there are maybe about three months ago I

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:41.340
didn't shut up to make money

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:46.750
course as I said I just don't have the
boredom right now and they expect each

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:53.470
in marketing to make money out of it but
two months three months later on its

00:07:53.470 --> 00:08:02.440
section the language bills now so what
I'm done is to set up a vision Easter

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:08.520
that its looks as best as I can without
hiring a designer I will do it some

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:18.550
point a gun at Chuck I engaged email
marketing so I'm using a company cold

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:30.220
drip stop getting there so with drip
what you can do it you can set up

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:38.409
automatic email broadcasts actually the
military broadcasts because those those

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:44.399
emails just cheney knows able to target
specific students when they do specific

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:45.420
things

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:55.279
so with chip as well I set up a form
that will spell in charge there in the

00:08:55.279 --> 00:08:59.730
middle of the page and landing page when
somebody goes to my website it will

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:08.230
promise a crash course and I do not
cooperate on Nov six episodes so that's

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:11.860
giving out then you without actually
asking for any money out front

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:19.060
lost count at all think about 27 percent
conversion rate on that form which is

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:28.149
very high in the industry so I've tried
things like that and the medicine that

00:09:28.149 --> 00:09:35.329
are set up text photo TV were so that
could have to be content to show how to

00:09:35.329 --> 00:09:42.639
market a product independently of
Udinese

00:09:42.639 --> 00:09:49.230
marketing higher power and just like
with you in the know about two years to

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:57.740
start making a reasonable income I think
this conversation again a year from now

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:03.399
over 30 years from now I think that
particular the TV I'll be able to

00:10:03.399 --> 00:10:07.019
achieve something similar this time

00:10:07.019 --> 00:10:16.810
able to control my own marketing and my
own market but she's I want to be in

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:21.360
these camps for the long term so i cant
see any other way of doing it you've

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:28.620
gotta have some independence you do me
maybe around today knows no pain yet

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:34.390
remember that might be completely
changed or that in the past now that the

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:36.050
change the game

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:43.100
80% now 28 2010 and so on the nose so
you do not have some of the same time

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:51.490
recommend to everybody not just a little
bit of money aside and try out and he

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:56.569
actually tried about how to do your own
likely have to be or not
