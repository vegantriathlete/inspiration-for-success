00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.330
yeah so this was so you chose to project
saying let me put something together

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.769
kind of test the market see how things
go in and so it's not like when you put

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:16.980
this gross out there that it caught on
fire and need this money in the money

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.730
now

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:29.550
forces published so what you the
evidence in the desire to produce some

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.680
of these additional courses even though
with his first course news made a little

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.210
bit of money but certainly wasn't gonna
be enough money to support yourself so

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:51.680
what types of things did you change that
confidence to continue our courses yeah

00:00:51.680 --> 00:01:01.480
very true so I wasn't able to create
more jobs I had a steady nice you can

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:11.140
come and take the kids to the movies but
definitely not to feed them and I

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:17.090
started examining my options I liked
doing what I was doing anyway I was

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.240
having good fun

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:26.020
researching the topics in creating the
pictures I knew that the increasing

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:34.570
enrollment is fairly healthy or somebody
who does know marketing and all that

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:43.020
right I can it I would need about maybe
ten years to make enough money so I was

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:52.590
trying to educate myself as well what do
that make gasoline dollars some of them

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.320
are very prominent and they were
publishing their incomes and had an

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:05.030
opportunity I signed up some of the
causes a lot of what they're saying

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.910
didn't really apply to my situation I
think for example that you must publish

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:18.760
different cultures and will be used
against that didn't apply to me because

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:28.820
I felt that I had to spend a lot of time
in the two get one cause published so I

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:34.960
decided that it's time to set up a new
course and published a new clothes and

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.470
again you know there is a trick out with
these things always when you are still

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.220
getting new lectures you must first
course in order stopped working on the

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:53.080
second when you try to decide that there
was one trigger so one company came and

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.930
asked me to develop some materials for
them they wanted to build a cautious

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.020
with kids teaching technology so I said
yeah no problem

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:09.170
ordered for you retain your age you
don't like a win-win situation I guess I

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:16.220
could count on approach then so that it
working on on that course by the end of

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.690
it they disappeared I don't know what
happened to them at the end of the back

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:30.020
ahead of course so I publish what I had
on to get me started doing a bit of

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:36.320
cross something with my existing
students and I dunno SBS I did have some

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:42.110
sales so it and it ended a little bit
more to my total at the end of the month

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:50.620
again he wasn't enough could see an
improvement in my and my statement every

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.640
month from the thought that that doesn't
look too bad if I develop about 10

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.709
cautious it was between 10 and 15
question makes two years I'll be able to

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:08.980
create jobs so let's start with the one
that went to me about maybe two months

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.239
but there was a turning point

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:19.150
third course a lot better than I
expected show it

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:25.690
it didn't go too leniently as I had
calculated but not exponentially but

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:26.680
something in between

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.530
between nine and expansion when I
published a number three course and then

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:39.960
I did some cross-selling to my students
on you to me I did think about two hours

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:47.030
after I sent that email about $500 which
was the normal monthly revenue at the

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:55.830
point of course a diet but the taught me
a lesson taught me that in Yunnan me

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:02.479
even though they got the extremely
attached themselves but there is still

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:12.340
room to make a good profit if you have
really liked you and they're ready to

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:21.440
buy next course makes course of course
is the same stuff or better so that

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:30.340
that's trigger and that actually was
used to prove to me that that strategy

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:36.380
has married so that was the last thing
and I'll end main methodology and then

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:37.750
start up G

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:44.900
approach ahead enough proof to that
point to get a lot more confident in

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:53.190
continuing that way with you to me so
after that I'm massively reduced my face

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:53.900
to face

00:05:53.900 --> 00:06:01.070
University where I used to teach at four
universities back and show that was not

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:11.220
ready but very happy days it is great
too much work so yes that you have one

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:17.770
class that are you like teaching see
kids on a couple of days a week

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:28.550
time I see messages from my students so
you did this I pretty much knew you were

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:37.680
gonna switch your focus to creating and
marketing courses really scale back in

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.479
our time that you spend university
courses and I know what we had talked

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:48.509
preparation and you interviewed for this
you had mentioned to me about how your

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:53.979
YouTube courses were doing in comparison
to what you were doing at the

00:06:53.979 --> 00:07:12.610
university's tell the listeners what you
hit relate your YouTube it let's say two

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:23.360
years ago I use more about as much as I
will be marking exams at the end of the

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:33.270
semester right nothing now just it
without punishing numbers so I can say

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:42.240
that it's enough to actually not need
any university income it's it's a bad at

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:50.190
the same level so for me that is
definitely a game changer not only

00:07:50.190 --> 00:08:04.990
stress fate but also in its proved to me
that I can concentrate on delivering new

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:12.090
cautious that increasingly a better than
my old horses and just know a lot more

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:19.650
not just on the technology side but also
how to deliver in an online platform and

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:25.949
in one of the things I mentioned back in
the preparation which that teaching

00:08:25.949 --> 00:08:30.200
online very different to teaching in a
university

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:34.750
I don't want to talk about that will
mean that the biggest difference between

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:36.600
two years ago and now
