00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.279
alright so the last thing is that the
Chancellor you did show you this TX

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:13.210
for.com if you just see that he is
advertising is courses as he said he's

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.630
got a lot of this blog post basic
questions that he has class from

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.090
students multi-purpose that content put
it on the blog and the good thing about

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.140
that is that since driven from questions
that class

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.430
rich with keywords and students are
gonna be searching out to be able to

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.460
find his are you finding that your blog
does do reasonably good job of

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:48.910
generating yeah I believe show it's hard
to say because it doesn't have that much

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:59.160
traffic 11 source of traffic to my
website that I know for sure is your

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:14.460
YouTube so and YouTube channel and what
about 3,000 followers there what happens

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.070
is whenever I complete a lecture I have
played a bunch of these elections are

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:27.189
you up when I finish course I upload a
bunch of pictures from the course into a

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:35.310
new playlist in my YouTube channel and
put in a detailed description and a lot

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.500
of keywords because at least in my space
when somebody's looking for information

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:48.460
on how to make and motifs in to YouTube
first and had pop in modo Spain are

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:55.040
doing so he got all the right keywords
and I sign a contract this that the

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.840
number one source of traffic to my
website is actually YouTube account

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.060
YouTube cups from Egypt to my Web Start
button and sign up eventually

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:16.340
that that that is a big no source
definitely future should be part of your

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:26.290
strategy okay that you're making sure
that your posting on you two are hitting

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.670
on some of these rich keywords your
prospects will be searching they find

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:40.680
your courses are getting close to an
hour here I know that I start a little

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:51.130
bit late I do want to open up here and
asked directly weekend a few minutes for

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:59.930
that we work winding down and the
interview here and waiting to see if

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:08.340
anybody has a desire to take a question
you just wanna go ahead and wrap up

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:19.120
first year 10 people or if you could
wrap up tell us what's your goals that

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:40.010
you hear a motor for a long time no more
it's a lot more actually my my 1 I'm

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.489
planning out a little bit about planning
in a minute when I'm planning to have a

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.220
bunch or what you want to do in my
pipeline but when time comes to the next

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.190
one up to be very careful what did you
know that whichever public I choose from

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.930
my nation in my pipeline it's the thing
that I've been working on for the next

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.000
three months at a lost cause took about
three months so it's about three months

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.810
of course

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:16.910
so about cleaning up so I think that's
the central idea that I want to know the

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:25.340
take-home lesson from this new image
that in my experience it's now or never

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:37.820
had a very quick refresher it's never
been quick getting tense and income in

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:46.860
your to me it's always a gradual process
and although most of us it doesn't start

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:55.210
with much as I said before just said
next day I'm doing this course planet hi

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:01.490
pup tent up to 20 election that shit no
planning essentially it can't continue

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:07.860
like that for too long cuz you know
things get better thanks I get specially

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:14.750
when you start getting a job so planning
once you reach that stage is extremely

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.729
potent

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:25.400
so everybody's different in terms of
planning I do I use online tools to help

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:35.560
me out guys tusks chairs alright guys
cautious retired activity which I tried

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:44.190
to maximize every hour that are put in
so yesterday for example I was working

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:49.000
on taking the script that are created
for my arrest rate hike all turning it

00:05:49.000 --> 00:06:00.419
into an e-book Publishing 100 maybe next
week my putting up courses to write a

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:04.940
script the script everything almost
anything no I don't skip the experiment

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.310
in the damage because they're generally
more free rolling but everything else ok

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:18.169
thank those scripts and so on the same
public

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:26.189
some people like to reach you would like
to watch everybody doing my products and

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:29.800
what-have-you planning really commit

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:37.389
energy in it it's going to be very hard
now everybody's got their situations my

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:43.479
case my studio it's in my home almost
home schooling kids so my home is always

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:50.080
full of people in eighty everybody in
the household and try to get the

00:06:50.080 --> 00:07:08.509
challenge that I had I know that others
homes change stations always give up for

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:18.400
something that is lesser quality just to
get it out of the door with a bit of

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:25.810
patience will be rewarded shots in it so
many times really is you have those

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:31.560
ingredients your approach to this entry
much of any other product you'll do it

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:50.409

worst of 2010 you can use that and I

00:07:50.409 --> 00:08:04.159
