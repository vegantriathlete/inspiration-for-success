00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
you write it so we would actually done
something that I did you put together

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:13.630
like a newer course that you had
proposed to the university correct yeah

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:19.250
yeah that's correct yes it's home loss
of the discourse that you had you know

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.640
had intended to put together the
University like may be addressed this

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:31.769
issue that she's heading to hot stuff is
kind of out of date so what did you do

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.940
with this ideology had course how did
you approach that it's a great example

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:44.120
that's actually how I better see what
what kicked me in a way into you know me

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:52.690
so I did have a plan to get into online
education and clutch online courses for

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.809
a couple of years for this happened but
you know you always need to trigger so

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:05.390
what happened was that about six or
seven years of teaching the subject a

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:13.030
retired and the university was somebody
take it over and I was a good candidate

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.180
since

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.850
subject now so they asked me to say yep
no problem I'll do it

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:28.320
asking a judge to update it but they
were kidding about that they were sent

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:37.729
via an upgrade so said yes I'll do it
they asked him give them a plan I did so

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:49.299
I i plan subject of the state of yacht
cheese cloud latest version so they

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:55.200
should that stuff we're building project
because I truly believe that project

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.960
based learning it's probably the best
ingredient cannot get rounded education

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:12.760
course so I gave them my proposal and
they went to get it done so they wanted

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.340
to

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:23.840
a sum of money but not enough to support
a family is pretty bad and they

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:33.140
basically another important thing is
that they wanted to remove all traces of

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:44.420
people you work so I found it very very
bad money wasn't an option to blunt

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.010
about it

00:02:45.010 --> 00:03:01.620
told them that they were no trace my
work which was going to be 20 so I said

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.069
no I lightly and makes day I started
working on my first course in you to me

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:21.579
so they were secure needed at that point
I was dead and can't get change so some

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:28.230
very good points in this because I'm me
was I think its second yeah it was clean

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:40.380
the need our space and I had researched
they all had issue sometimes big issues

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:51.609
as they reach the market had no clue how
I could get students into my closet hey

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:59.239
so they were so there's a hole in your
discussion questions

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.579
sure so what you just mentioned here
though is that that's pretty much where

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:07.549
you had like you say you pull the
trigger decided you were gonna go

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:16.070
because you realize wow that was going
to be much more

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:22.130
I take the time to put together this
outline and then when I propose it to

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.180
the University

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.450
first of all the salary that they wanted
to offer for was not an adequate salary

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.370
and then on top of it they didn't want
to give any type of retribution so

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:41.440
people know that you would like this is
like i dont wanna continue in this

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.600
direction so let me try putting this
together in a different way this was the

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:52.850
first together in unity in that they
basically that next day and you started

00:04:52.850 --> 00:05:08.770
putting together the course and so is
working on this first course than 13 ok

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:24.550
and indeed you just the first published
so that that cause was designed it was

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:32.830
designed to stage a wide range of
elementary level

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:42.500
think of it as an introductory caused to
so it's not specific enough not tight

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.790
enough credit for it to be an
independent course unlike you I never

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.950
thought of actually making that turning
it into a court many components award

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:59.820
but not so the next day and what I did
was you go back to my childhood she said

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:09.110
in the introduction and design a caution
electronics my childhood spent a large

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:19.000
part of my childhood and we usually so I
had another in a long line in one of my

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:26.220
drawers folks

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.840
played with it with that

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:35.720
never had enough time to do it now she's
a head and he didn't have the time to

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:41.020
sit down and started designing a new
course based on the Arduino another

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:46.419
interesting thing to note here is that
my choice for the other you know was

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:59.490
just on my like you I wanted to learn
more about it so what I did was went to

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:08.060
you to me are doing of course you know
me and I didn't find any and I couldn't

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:15.940
believe it was a major platform in the
medical community in electronics and in

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:22.500
the largest online online course
platform in the world there was no

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:31.030
course when you turn me on when the
Adreno so I saw an opportunity this is

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:32.750
just not right

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:40.820
tricksters so that's that's why I
decided to start work on the idea that

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:49.820
moment it was the University then I
gotta feeling that gotta do this right

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:56.430
now check out that somebody's going to
steal right away which happened yeah so

00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:15.710
because in learning more about that when
he decided that was a good opportunity

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:23.380
because there was an opening there are
you more of a risk when you get there

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:24.580
are many other courses

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:36.360
the person who's Lake first-to-market go
for you when you think of that but I

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:41.659
interpreted it as an infection in the
market

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:48.269
I knew for a fact that I dunno was big
gathering at the point where I got into

00:08:48.269 --> 00:08:53.860
it already had millions wage there were
large companies making stock the end of

00:08:53.860 --> 00:09:04.769
you know i phone market but it was a
very healthy and growing Mike room each

00:09:04.769 --> 00:09:10.640
market and there were a few books about
it so I could see that unlocked

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:16.660
publishes would invest the money to buy
with the other you know just things were

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:22.320
studied it is not a thing when it
happens but no one had a bit of

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:29.040
knowledge in a particular area it's
easier to to see section she weighs

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:37.220
telling them or avoiding the elections
so I decided that it was erected getting

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:43.699
of course there's always the risk factor
I didn't have a limited time so I was

00:09:43.699 --> 00:09:54.699
also a follow-up after all where Lynch
top methodology with lean startup Lean

00:09:54.699 --> 00:10:00.029
Startup methodology the basic idea is
that you

00:10:00.029 --> 00:10:07.880
prototype I get you collect data from
the market just your strategy and then

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:16.000
he continued so I didn't want to go
crazy with this course and spend six

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:16.980
months or a year

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:20.699
time building something that perhaps I
was wrong about that the regional market

00:10:20.699 --> 00:10:28.769
about for me so I decided to go with a
micro course so I did the talking about

00:10:28.769 --> 00:10:35.209
20 elections three sections I was also
named the road to the same time I had

00:10:35.209 --> 00:10:37.970
never recorded anything before that had
no idea

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:43.769
gonna shop with the use a used a cheap
webcam recordings my lights were

00:10:43.769 --> 00:10:50.709
horrible many times you can still see
them in my views but cost comparison

00:10:50.709 --> 00:11:02.439
anyway I did my twenty horses so much
twenty launch them couple of days later

00:11:02.439 --> 00:11:12.480
I had once I think maybe toussaud's
Monday night maybe 10 or 12 days but you

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:20.449
know when I reached the hundred $150
market haven't actually done anything to

00:11:20.449 --> 00:11:26.100
promote it seems to be doing something
to bring people and most of them were

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:32.959
organic sales and advertising so then I
started feeling obligated about much

00:11:32.959 --> 00:11:38.540
with Richard and I did give them or so
that's when I started continuing the

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:42.769
development of that same course it is
that a new one just continue needs new

00:11:42.769 --> 00:11:49.110
lectures on topics that I thought would
be interested to these existing students

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:56.019
and one thing led to the other six six
months later it was about 15 hours so

00:11:56.019 --> 00:12:01.220
it's now I just get a good team
developing it two years later it's now

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:10.529
22 hours I think and I'm still every now
and then heading elections to it depends

00:12:10.529 --> 00:12:17.319
on what the house if I get a three or
four requests on the same topic then I

00:12:17.319 --> 00:12:23.629
will schedule it in and development you
picture for the topic yesterday
