In the course introduction, I mentioned that there was a section in the course where I ask you to contact me about being interviewed. Well, you have now reached that section!

Remember that you define success for yourself. If you believe that you have achieved success, then get in touch with me so that I can interview you and you can share it! If you just want to "test the waters" and bounce your thoughts off me to see if your success is inspiring enough, get in touch with me!

You may actually have more of an impact on others by sharing some success that may seem relatively small than if you share some extreme accomplishment. The more people can relate to what you have done and believe that they can do it too, the more likely that they will be spurred into action.

Have I mentioned that you should get in touch?

You can use the message system that Udemy provides.

I look forward to hearing from you!
